# DODOv3 approve cannot interact with some tokens such as USDT

## Summary

According to the documentation, DODOv3 supports any standard ERC20 token. However, for some tokens, such as USDT, a non-0 value of approve is not allowed when allowance is non-0, in order to prevent the frontrun attack of approve.    

## Vulnerability Detail

Approve is called directly in the code such as D3Funding and D3MMLiquidationRouter without set allowance to 0. When allowance is not 0 (second call), tokens such as USDT will revert.   

Changing the MockERC20 code to the approve code of USDT will see this error:

## Impact

DODOv3 cannot interact with tokens like USDT, which make up a large percentage of the market.
