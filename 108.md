# user can start `liquidation` process even if vault is not `eligible`

## Summary
- the vulnerability present in the `checkCanBeLiquidated()` function, so if you call the `checkCanBeLiquidated()` function on a vault that is not eligible for liquidation, and If the function returns true, then the problem is present.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity 
 function checkCanBeLiquidated() public view returns (bool) {
        return ID3Vault(state._D3_VAULT_).checkCanBeLiquidated(address(this));
    }

    function startLiquidation() external onlyVault {
        isInLiquidation = true;
    }

    function finishLiquidation() external onlyVault {
        isInLiquidation = false;
    }

    function _updateReserve(address token) internal {
        state.balances[token] = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    }
```
- the `checkCanBeLiquidated()` returns true if the vault can be liquidated this means that a malicious user could call the `checkCanBeLiquidated()` function to see if the vault is eligible for liquidation.
If the vault is eligible for liquidation, the malicious user could then call the `startLiquidation()` function to start the liquidation process. This would allow the malicious user to take control of the vault and its assets.
## Impact
-  if a  malicious users exploit this can take control of a vault and its assets so this is leading the loss of funds for the pool and its users

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- changing the `checkCanBeLiquidated()` function to only return true if the vault has enough collateral to cover its debt.
