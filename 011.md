# Unsafe usage of `transfer()` and `transferFrom()`

## Summary

Using unsafe ERC20 methods can revert the transaction for certain tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol currently uses any tokens:

> Which ERC20 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts?
> - ERC20: any

The `ERC20.transfer()` and `ERC20.transferFrom()` functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

## Impact

Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer and tokens that don't correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec will be unusable in the protocol as they revert the transaction because of the missing return value.

```solidity
D3VaultLiquidation.sol

55: IERC20(debt).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), debtToCover);
59: IERC20(collateral).transferFrom(pool, msg.sender, collateralAmount);
98: IERC20(order.fromToken).transferFrom(pool, router, order.fromAmount);
145: IERC20(token).transferFrom(pool, address(this), debt);
```

```solidity
D3MMLiquidationRouter.sol

31: IERC20(order.toToken).transfer(msg.sender, IERC20(order.toToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the `safeTransfer()` and `safeTransferFrom()` functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
