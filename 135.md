# addressToShortString method gives same result for two different address (LOW)

## Summary
In d3token addressToShortString method gives same result for two different address

## Vulnerability Detail

1. 0x378C71dA117b43C1DC0abB15354FC40fBbcAEA9E
2. 0x378c71DA117b43c1dC0ABb15354Fc40fBbcAea9d

output were same

## Code Snippet

 function testAddressToShortStringSame() public {
        string memory adtEST2 = d3Token.addressToShortString(
            address(0x378C71dA117b43C1DC0abB15354FC40fBbcAEA9E)
        );
        string memory adtEST3 = d3Token.addressToShortString(
            address(0x378c71DA117b43c1dC0ABb15354Fc40fBbcAea9d)
        );

        console.log("adtEST2 = ", adtEST2);
        console.log("adtEST3 = ", adtEST3);

        // both address are different but output is same
        assertEq(adtEST2, adtEST3);
    }
