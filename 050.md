# Fee transfer should check that the amount is not 0

## Summary

DODO is deployed to BNB, and transfer zero is prohibited for BNB tokens. If you do not check that amount is 0, the user is prevented from using the protocol when fee is 0.

## Vulnerability Detail

Tokens such as BNB do not support zero-value transfer and should check that the amount is not 0 before tranfer fee, otherwise the entire tx will revert.

## Impact

When fee is 0, the user cannot interact with the protocol using tokens such as BNB, the functions such as buyToken and sellToken are unavailable.
