# Title: Insufficient Balance Check in `sellToken` Function Allows Execution with Insufficient `fromToken` Balance

## Summary
The `sellToken` function in the provided contract code contains an incorrect balance check. This issue arises when verifying the contract's balance of the `fromToken` after transferring tokens out. As a result, it is possible for the function to proceed with execution even if the contract does not have sufficient `fromToken` balance after the transfer.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `sellToken` function checks the contract's balance of `fromToken` before the transfer but does not consider the `fromAmount` that will be transferred out. Therefore, the balance check may pass even if the contract does not have enough `fromToken` balance after the transfer.
## Impact
1. It may allow the contract to execute the transaction even if it doesn't have enough `fromToken` balance, leading to inconsistent state and potential issues in subsequent operations.
2. Users relying on the balance check may assume that the contract has sufficient `fromToken` balance, leading to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

## Proof of Concept (PoC):
1. Deploy the contract and provide insufficient `fromToken` balance to the contract.
2. Invoke the `sellToken` function with `fromAmount` exceeding the available balance.
3. Observe that the function executes successfully without throwing an error, even though the contract's `fromToken` balance is insufficient after the transfer.
## Recommendation
1. After the token transfer is made in the `sellToken` function, retrieve the updated balance of `fromToken` in a separate variable (`fromTokenBalanceAfter`).
4. Compare the difference between `fromTokenBalanceAfter` and `state.balances[fromToken]` with `fromAmount`.
5. If the difference is less than `fromAmount`, revert the transaction and throw an appropriate error indicating insufficient `fromToken` balance.
