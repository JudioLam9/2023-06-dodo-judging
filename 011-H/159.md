# Incorrect rounding directions can run out of the vault

## Summary

Vault implementers should be aware of the need for specific, opposing rounding directions across the different mutable and view methods, as it is considered most secure to favor the Vault itself during calculations over its users:
If (1) it’s calculating how many shares to issue to a user for a certain amount of the underlying tokens they provide or (2) it’s determining the amount of the underlying tokens to transfer to them for returning a certain amount of shares, it should round down.
If (1) it’s calculating the amount of shares a user has to supply to receive a given amount of the underlying tokens or (2) it’s calculating the amount of underlying tokens a user has to provide to receive a certain amount of shares, it should round up.   

The same is true for other implementations, such as the user call `repayAll`, where the amount to be repaid should be `borrowAmount / exchangeRate + 1`, and failure to round up results in the repayment being less than borrowed. Over time, the vault will be run out of.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are a few examples, which I list below:

```solidity
    function _poolRepayAll(address pool, address token) internal {
        accrueInterest(token);

        AssetInfo storage info = assetInfo[token];
        BorrowRecord storage record = info.borrowRecord[pool];
        uint256 amount = record.amount.div(record.interestIndex == 0 ? 1e18 : record.interestIndex).mul(info.borrowIndex);

        uint256 interests = amount;

        record.amount = 0;
        record.interestIndex = info.borrowIndex;
        info.totalBorrows = info.totalBorrows - amount;
        info.balance = info.balance - amount;
        // @audit amount rounding down is wrong
        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(pool, address(this), amount);

        emit PoolRepay(pool, token, amount, interests);
    }
```

```solidity
    function startLiquidation(address pool) external onlyLiquidator nonReentrant {
        accrueInterests();

        require(!ID3MM(pool).isInLiquidation(), Errors.ALREADY_IN_LIQUIDATION);
        require(checkCanBeLiquidatedAfterAccrue(pool), Errors.CANNOT_BE_LIQUIDATED);
        ID3MM(pool).startLiquidation();

        uint256 totalAssetValue = getTotalAssetsValue(pool);
        uint256 totalDebtValue = _getTotalDebtValue(pool);
        require(totalAssetValue < totalDebtValue, Errors.NO_BAD_DEBT);

        uint256 ratio = totalAssetValue.div(totalDebtValue);

        for (uint256 i; i < tokenList.length; i++) {
            address token = tokenList[i];
            AssetInfo storage info = assetInfo[token];
            BorrowRecord storage record = info.borrowRecord[pool];
            uint256 debt = record.amount.div(record.interestIndex == 0 ? 1e18 : record.interestIndex).mul(info.borrowIndex).mul(ratio);
            // @audit debt should be rounded up
            liquidationTarget[pool][token] = debt;
        }
    }
```

## Impact

The vault is returned less than the amount borrowed before, over time the vault will be run out of.

## Recommendation

When the pool repays, the amount calculation should be rounded up rather than down
