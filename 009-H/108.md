# Users will lose their tokens while trying to deposit to the vault with `userDeposit()` if the `maxDepositAmount` is exceeded

## Summary
This protocol lets users to deposit directly to the vault with `D3VaultFunding.sol` contract or lets them deposit through the `D3Proxy.sol` contract. Users will lose their tokens and not get any dTokens if `maxDepositAmount` is exceeded when they choose to deposit to the vault directly. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol gives users different options for depositing to the vault. Users can deposit directly to the vault with `userDeposit()`, or they can use the `D3Proxy` contract which will then call the same `userDeposit()` function in the vault.

As a design feature, this protocol uses a two-step deposit.  
Users are expected to send tokens to the vault, and then call the `userDeposit()` function to let the vault know that they already sent tokens. The `userDeposit()` function will compare the real token balance and the previously recorded token balance, and assume that the difference is sent by the user. After that, it will check if the received token amount will cause exceeded `maxDepositAmount` or not. If it exceeds, the function will revert and the user won't get any `dToken`. Let's check the function code in the `D3VaultFunding.sol` contract:

```solidity
//File: D3VaultFunding.sol
28.--> /// @notice user should transfer token to vault before call this function
29.    function userDeposit(address user, address token) external nonReentrant allowedToken(token) {
30.        accrueInterest(token);
31.
32.        AssetInfo storage info = assetInfo[token];
33.-->     uint256 realBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
34.-->     uint256 amount = realBalance  - info.balance;
35.        require(ID3UserQuota(_USER_QUOTA_).checkQuota(user, token, amount), Errors.EXCEED_QUOTA);
36.        uint256 exchangeRate = _getExchangeRate(token);
37.        uint256 totalDToken = IDToken(info.dToken).totalSupply();
38.-->     require(totalDToken.mul(exchangeRate) + amount <= info.maxDepositAmount, Errors.EXCEED_MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT);
39.        uint256 dTokenAmount = amount.div(exchangeRate);
40.
41.        IDToken(info.dToken).mint(user, dTokenAmount);
42.        info.balance = realBalance;
43.
44.        emit UserDeposit(user, token, amount);
45.    }
```

- As you can see in the developer's comment in line 28 above, users have to send tokens to the vault first.

- In lines 33-34, a calculation is made to get the difference between balances and it is assumed that the user sent the `amount` of tokens.

- A require statement checks if the amount sent to the vault will cause exceeding or not in line 38. It will revert if the max deposit amount is exceeded. **Users won't get anything** in terms of `dToken` but they already sent the tokens and **those tokens will not be refunded.**

You can argue that this is a user mistake but unfortunately, this is not a simple user input issue. This is how the protocol is designed. We can't defend this problem by saying "Users should have checked if the max deposit will be reached", or "They should've deposited through the `D3Proxy`". 
The current implementation will cause one or more regular, honest users to lose their funds. Even if a user checks the max deposit before sending the transaction, that transaction might execute a few blocks later, and other users might deposit in previous blocks etc. Users will lose funds even if they do nothing wrong.

## Impact
Users will lose their funds while trying to deposit them into the vault.

```solidity
//File: D3VaultFunding.sol
28.--> /// @notice user should transfer token to vault before call this function
29.    function userDeposit(address user, address token) external nonReentrant allowedToken(token) {
30.        accrueInterest(token);
31.
32.        AssetInfo storage info = assetInfo[token];
33.-->     uint256 realBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
34.-->     uint256 amount = realBalance  - info.balance;
35.        require(ID3UserQuota(_USER_QUOTA_).checkQuota(user, token, amount), Errors.EXCEED_QUOTA);
36.        uint256 exchangeRate = _getExchangeRate(token);
37.        uint256 totalDToken = IDToken(info.dToken).totalSupply();
38.-->     require(totalDToken.mul(exchangeRate) + amount <= info.maxDepositAmount, Errors.EXCEED_MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT);
39.        uint256 dTokenAmount = amount.div(exchangeRate);
40.
41.        IDToken(info.dToken).mint(user, dTokenAmount);
42.        info.balance = realBalance;
43.
44.        emit UserDeposit(user, token, amount);
45.    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There might be two different approaches I could recommend to mitigate this issue and both of them are based on removing the two-step deposit process.

**First approach**: Don't let users deposit directly to the vault and force them to use the D3Proxy. Add an "***onlyProxy***" modifier to the `userDeposit()` function in the vault.

**Second approach**: Use **approval/safeTransferFrom** rather than expecting users to send the tokens and call the function. Users can approve the vault contract for transfer and when they call the `userDeposit()` function, the vault contract transfers tokens from the user to the vault. Because this transfer will be called inside the function, users won't lose their tokens if something reverts. Like this:

```solidity
29.    function userDeposit(address user, address token, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant allowedToken(token) {
30.        accrueInterest(token);
31.--->    IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(user, msg.sender, amount);
       //......
       //......
```
