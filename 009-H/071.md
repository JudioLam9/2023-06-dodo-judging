# Frontrunning on deposit via the userDeposit function in the D3VaultFunding contract [H1]

## Summary

Before calling the function, the user must transfer the tokens to the repository, which follows from the comment: [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultFunding.sol#L28). However, an attacker could monitor the vault balance and call this function instead of the user, or, if monitoring the mempool and when calling this function, frontrunning the transaction and stealing dTokens

## Vulnerability Detail

1) User transfers tokens to the storage address
2) Function userDeposit(address user, address token) is called, where user is who to transfer dTokens, and token is address of tokens that were transferred into storage
3) The amount of dTokens depends on the difference between the real balance and the vault balance in info 
4) dTokens are minted for user address

In step 2 the attacker may mint his own address instead of the user's address:
a) with frontrunning
b) if the user didn't call this fonction, he can call it himself

## Impact

An attacker can steal a dToken

## Code Snippet
```solidity
   /// @notice user should transfer token to vault before call this function
    function userDeposit(address user, address token) external nonReentrant allowedToken(token) { 
        accrueInterest(token);

        AssetInfo storage info = assetInfo[token]; 
        uint256 realBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 amount = realBalance  - info.balance;
        require(ID3UserQuota(_USER_QUOTA_).checkQuota(user, token, amount), Errors.EXCEED_QUOTA);
        uint256 exchangeRate = _getExchangeRate(token);
        uint256 totalDToken = IDToken(info.dToken).totalSupply();
        require(totalDToken.mul(exchangeRate) + amount <= info.maxDepositAmount, Errors.EXCEED_MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT);
        uint256 dTokenAmount = amount.div(exchangeRate);

        IDToken(info.dToken).mint(user, dTokenAmount);
        info.balance = realBalance;

        emit UserDeposit(user, token, amount);
    }
```

Rework the diposit logic in the vault
