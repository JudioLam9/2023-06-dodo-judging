# calculateQuota can easily be bypassed via flashloans or borrows

## Summary

D3UserQuota#calculateQuota adjusts user quota based on the number of tokens they are holding. This can easily be bypassed via flashloans or borrows to temporarily increase their balance. After they have deposited they can simply repay the loan and benefit from the higher quota that should be reserved for holders.

## Vulnerability Detail

See summary

## Impact

Balance based quota is broken by flashloans and borrows
