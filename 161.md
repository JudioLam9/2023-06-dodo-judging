# accrueInterests may block the liquidate process

## Summary

`accrueInterests` will update all tokens data, which may block the liquidate process.

## Vulnerability Detail

When liquidate, accrueInterests will update the internal accounting information of all tokens is updated, accrueInterests may block the liquidate process. There are two problems:
1. There is no limit on the tokenList length of the pool. When the pool reaches a certain level of maturity, liquidate may fail to run out of gas
2. When some unpopular token oracles go offline, the health of the entire pool is affected, pool cannot be liquidated, resulting in a continuous increase in bad debts.

## Impact

When some token information updates incorrectly in accrueInterests, the health of the whole pool is affected. The pool cannot be liquidated to stop the loss in time.
