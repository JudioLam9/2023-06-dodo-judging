# No check if Arbitrum Sequencer is active for oracle

## Summary

Chainlink recommends that all Optimistic L2 oracles check the Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure that the sequencer is live before trusting the data returned by the oracle. https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#l2-sequencer-uptime-feeds

## Vulnerability Detail

Chainlink recommends that users using price oracles, check whether the Arbitrum sequencer is active

https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#l2-sequencer-uptime-feeds

If the sequencer goes down, the index oracles may have stale prices, since L2-submitted transactions (i.e. by the aggregating oracles) will not be processed.

## Impact

If the Arbitrum sequencer goes down, the protocol will allow users to continue to operate at the previous (stale) rates.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add safety checks if the sequencer is active.
```solidity
function getPrice(address token) public view override returns (uint256) {
   if (!isSequencerActive()) revert Errors.L2SequencerUnavailable();
   ...
}
```

```solidity
function isSequencerActive() internal view returns (bool) {
    (, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt,,) = sequencer.latestRoundData();
    if (block.timestamp - startedAt <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME || answer == 1)
        return false;
    return true;
}
```
