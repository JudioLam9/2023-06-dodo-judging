# lastHeartBeat update value should be passed in as a argument, not execution time

## Summary

On a low-throughput blockchain network, a transaction may remain in mempool for a long time before it is executed, therefore execution time >= publish tx time.
The updated state is the state at the time of publication, so lastHeartBeat should be passed as a parameter like any other state, not taken from execution time.

## Vulnerability Detail

Malicious miners or searchers can listen to the state update transactions in the mempool, and they can manipulate the execution time of the transaction, wrap it in a sandwich attack, or delay execution by several blocks. This provides arbitrage space, since the state is the latest as long as the transaction is executed, because of `lastHeartBeat == block.timestamp`

## Impact

state update transactions may delay execute, and the old state is considered to be the latest state, leading to arbitrage space. The functions in the D3Maker contract are basically affected, indirectly affecting the buytoken and sellToken of D3Trading.
