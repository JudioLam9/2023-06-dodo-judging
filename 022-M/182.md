# No access control for the maker.multicall

## Summary
According to the DODO docs [here](https://docs.dodoex.io/english/contracts/dodo-v3/core/d3maker#multicall) and the code comment, the multicall function in the maker contract is used BY the market makers multicall to set different params in one tx.
However there is a flaw here. The maker contract has an Owner set but does not utilize this. 

```solidity
    /// @notice maker could use multicall to set different params in one tx.
    function multicall(bytes[] calldata data) external returns (bytes[] memory results) {
        results = new bytes[](data.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(data[i]);

            if (!success) {
                assembly {
                    revert(add(result, 32), mload(result))
                }
            }

            results[i] = result;
        }
    }
```
## Vulnerability Detail
From the example above, we see that the multicall function then those a delegatecall to an arbitrary data which could a hackers contract. This could be used to take direct control of setting prices because delegatecalls modify the calling contracts state while calling a function in another contract 
## Impact
It impacts all functions that requires maker access to set
