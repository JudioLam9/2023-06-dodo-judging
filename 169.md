# Exchange Rate can be gamed to steal all funds from vault

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
A token's exchange rate is calculated as such:

```solidity
function _getExchangeRate(address token) internal view returns (uint256) {
    AssetInfo storage info = assetInfo[token];
    uint256 cash = getCash(token);
    uint256 dTokenSupply = IERC20(info.dToken).totalSupply();
    if (dTokenSupply == 0) { return 1e18; }
    return (cash + info.totalBorrows - (info.totalReserves - info.withdrawnReserves)).div(dTokenSupply);
} 
```

`getCash()` is simply the contract's token balance variable which is updated on each operation that transfers tokens.

```solidity
function getCash(address token) public view returns (uint256) {
    return assetInfo[token].balance;
}
```

***Example exploit:***
Assume that there has not been any borrowing activity so borrow and reserve variables are all **0**.
- Current dToken supply = **1000**
- assetInfo[A].balance = **500**
- assetInfo[B].balance = **500**
- User holds **500 DTokens**
- Attacker holds **500 DTokens**

The current exchange rates are:
- ExchangeRateA = (500 + 0 - (0 - 0)) / 1000 = 50%
- ExchangeRateB = (500 + 0 - (0 - 0)) / 1000 = 50%

Attacker can take both 500 TokenA and 500 TokenB out of the vault with the following operation:

- Attacker withdraws **100** TokenA by burning **200 DToken**.

The current exchange rates are:
- ExchangeRateA = (400 + 0 - (0 - 0)) / 800 = 50%
- ExchangeRateB = (500 + 0 - (0 - 0)) / 800 = 62.5%
