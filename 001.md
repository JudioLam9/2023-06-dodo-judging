# No check if sequencer is up in D3Oracle

## Summary
The project can be launched on l2 such as abritrum or optimism, however in the `getPrice` method there's not check to see if the L2 sequencer is up.
## Vulnerability Detail
There are various check in place in `getPrice`, however there's no check to see if the L2 sequencer is up. This is especially usefull since it allows the protocol to have a grace period and only accepts output from the datafeed after a certain time has passed if the sequencer was down. 
## Impact
When the sequencer is down on an L2 such as arbitrum, any transaction will correctly revert since there are checks for stale data. However, the recommended way would be to implement it according to the Chainlink docs and allow for a grace period. This avoids bots abusing the situation when the sequencer comes back up.
