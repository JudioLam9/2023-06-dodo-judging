# D3VaultFunding#getCompoundInterestRate is incorrect at lower interest rates

## Summary

The general form of the compound interest calculation in conjunction with the precision loss of powFloor leads to incorrect interest rates when the current interest rate is below 3.15%.

## Vulnerability Detail

[DecimalMath.sol#L54-L67](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/a8d30e611acc9762029f8756d6a5b81825faf348/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/lib/DecimalMath.sol#L54-L67)

    function powFloor(uint256 target, uint256 e) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        if (e == 0) {
            return 10 ** 18;
        } else if (e == 1) {
            return target;
        } else {
            uint256 p = powFloor(target, e / 2);
            p = p * p / (10 ** 18); <- @audit-issue will result in zero if p is less than 1e9
            if (e % 2 == 1) {
                p = p * target / (10 ** 18);
            }
            return p;
        }
    }
    
First we consider DecimalMath#powFloor. It uses a recursive methodology to calculate the exponential. Since it is assumed that target is an 18 dp number there is an inherent precision loss for numbers under a certain threshold. We consider specifically an exponent of e = 2 (since this is the only usage across all contracts). Due to precision loss in L61, it will result in the function returning 0 if less than1e9.

    function getCompoundInterestRate(uint256 r, uint256 t) public pure returns (uint256) {
        if (t < 1) {
            return 1e18;
        } else if (t < 2) {
            return 1e18 + r * t;
        } else {
            return 1e18 + r * t + r.powFloor(2) * t * (t - 1) / 2;
        }
    }

When we consider `getCompoundInterestRate`, we see that the third portion of the final equation (r.powFloor(2) * t * (t - 1) / 2) will return 0 if r < 1e9 since powFloor(999999999, 2) = 0. While this is a very small value we should consider that this is the interest rate PER SECOND and needs to be translated to the interest rate per year:

    999999999 * 31536000 = 31535999968464000 = 0.0315e18 = 3.15%

The result is that if the yearly interest rate is less than 3.15% (as are a majority of tokens on other major lending platforms) then the interest rate will be calculated incorrectly. This will lead to loss of interest for all depositors in this scenario. 

## Impact

LPs will receive incorrect interest rates causing loss of yeild

## Recommendation

I would recommend using a different power function that doesn't suffer from this precision loss
