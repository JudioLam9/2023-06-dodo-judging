# Attacker can steal approved tokens from users through D3Proxy

## Summary
The `D3Proxy` contract has a `buyTokens` method and a `sellTokens` method, both of which allow a user to swap one token to another token through a pool. However, because there is no input validation on the user provided `data` object, the caller can specify another user address as the payer and effectively steal approved tokens from their wallet.

## Vulnerability Detail
The behaviour is almost identical between `buyTokens` and `sellTokens`, but for the sake of this explanation we'll use the `sellTokens` path. When a user calls `sellTokens` where `fromToken != _ETH_ADDRESS_`, there is no check that the user has transferred the required funds to the contract. An underlying `sellToken` call to the pool is then made, where a user specified `data` bytes argument is passed in as a parameter. In `D3Trading` the funds are collected from the user account with the following callback to the proxy:

```solidity
IDODOSwapCallback(msg.sender).d3MMSwapCallBack(fromToken, fromAmount, data);
```

This callback passes in the same data argument previously supplied by the user. The purpose of this callback and specifically the internal `_deposit` method is to pull the relevant token for the swap from the user account:

```solidity
_deposit(decodeData.payer, msg.sender, token, value);
```

As can be seen from the above snippet, the `from` argument for the `deposit` call is the `payer` value of the `SwapCallbackData` struct. This address is not validated at any point and therefore the original caller can pass in the address of any other account that has already approved tokens to DODO (i.e. they have interacted with DODO already). Thus, a malicious user can use the tokens of other users to swap between tokens in the pool, where the malicious user receives the `toToken`.

As mentioned above, this attack can be performed through both the `buyTokens` and `sellTokens` methods, as both use the same `d3MMSwapCallBack` logic. Below is a diff to the existing test case that shows how a user can steal tokens from another user:

## Impact
A malicious user can steal tokens from other users of DODO that have approved tokens to DODO.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
One option is to modify the `sellTokens` and `buyTokens` logic in `D3Proxy` to validate the input data or hardcode `msg.sender` into the `payer` variable of the `SwapCallbackData` struct.

Alternatively the pool `sellToken` and `buyToken` logic could be modified to not use the `d3MMSwapCallBack` method, but instead act more like the vault `userDeposit` and `userWithdraw` methods where tokens are pulled from the message sender. In this case you would modify the proxy to call `_deposit(msg.sender, pool, token, amount);` in both the `sellTokens` and `buyTokens` logic.
