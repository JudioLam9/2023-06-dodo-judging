# In D3Trading.sol, Missing deadline checks for sellToken() and buyToken() function allow pending transactions to be maliciously executed

## Summary
The D3Trading.sol contract sellToken() and buyToken() function  does not allow users to submit a deadline for their action. This missing deadline feature enables pending transactions to be maliciously executed at a later point.

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

In D3Trading.sol, sellToken() and buyToken() functions are used to buy and sell tokens and these are given as below,

```Solidity

91    function sellToken(
92        address to,
93        address fromToken,
94        address toToken,
95        uint256 fromAmount,
96        uint256 minReceiveAmount,
97        bytes calldata data
98    ) external poolOngoing nonReentrant returns (uint256) {

126        // some code
}


129    function buyToken(
130        address to,
131        address fromToken,
132        address toToken,
133        uint256 quoteAmount,
134        uint256 maxPayAmount,
135        bytes calldata data
136    ) external poolOngoing nonReentrant returns (uint256) {

        // some code
165 }
```

A seen above, sellToken() and buyToken() does not have deadline paramter.

The D3Trading.sol should provide  users with an option to limit the execution of the pending actions like in case of sellToken() and buyToken() . The most common solution is to include a deadline timestamp as a parameter (for example see [Uniswap V2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/0335e8f7e1bd1e8d8329fd300aea2ef2f36dd19f/contracts/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L229)). **If such an option is not present, users can unknowingly perform bad trades:**

**For example to understand the need of deadline:** 
1. Rose wants to swap 100 fractional NFT tokens (fTokens) for 1 ETH and later sell the 1 ETH for 1000 DAI. She signs the transaction calling Pair.sell with inputAmount = 100 fTokens and minOutputAmount = 0.99 ETH to allow for some slippage.
2. The transaction is submitted to the mempool, however, Rose chose a transaction fee that is too low for miners to be interested in including her transaction in a block. The transaction stays pending in the mempool for extended periods, which could be hours, days, weeks, or even longer.
3. When the average gas fee dropped far enough for Rose's transaction to become interesting again for miners to include it, her swap will be executed. In the meantime, the price of ETH could have drastically changed. She will still at least get 0.99 ETH due to minOutputAmount, but the DAI value of that output might be significantly lower. She has unknowingly performed a bad trade due to the pending transaction she forgot about.

**An even worse way this issue can be maliciously exploited is through MEV:**

The swap transaction is still pending in the mempool. Average fees are still too high for miners to be interested in it. The price of fToken has gone up significantly since the transaction was signed, meaning Rose would receive a lot more ETH when the swap is executed. But that also means that her minOutputAmount value is outdated and would allow for significant slippage.
A MEV bot detects the pending transaction. Since the outdated minOutputAmount now allows for high slippage, the bot sandwiches Rose, resulting in significant profit for the bot and significant loss for Rose.
