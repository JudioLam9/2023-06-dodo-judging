# Incorrect internal accounting when calling `_poolRepayAll`

## Summary

Incorrect internal accounting will occur in `D3Vault` when calling [`_poolRepayAll`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultFunding.sol#L117)

## Vulnerability Detail

`_poolRepayAll()` is used to repay all of pools debt, however when updating [`info.balance`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultFunding.sol#L129) on L129, which represents the amount of underlying token in the vault the wrong arithmetic operator is used. 
```solidity
info.balance = info.balance - amount;
```
We can see it updated correctly in [`poolRepay()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultFunding.sol#L107).
```solidity
info.balance = info.balance + amount;
```

## Impact

Updating `info.balance` of the vault incorrectly will cause problems because it will seem as the `amount` was borrowed instead of repaid. And could potentially cause other functions to not work.
