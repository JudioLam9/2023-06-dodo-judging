# All users of the vault may suffer a huge loss because of DOS attack from unexpected new token supporting.

## Summary
A uncontrolled use of loop could cause a huge amount of gas consumption and trigger a Deny Of Service because of block gas limit, thereafter the critical functions of the whole protocol may be unavailable and there is no way to recover the whole protocol back to available status.

All above functions uses a loop to calculate the result. The count of loop depends on the length of `tokenList`.  It's obvious that the protocol is willing to add support for more tokens, which means the length of `tokenList` will be increased rapidly, and the gas consumption of above functions will grow rapidly. At some point, the gas consumption may exceed the block gas limit, and the whole function will be reverted, which is a classical [DoS With Block Gas Limit](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-128). 

## Impact
Any Functions that directly or indirectly call the above functions will be reverted. 
- `D3Trading#sellToken()`
- `D3Trading#buyToken()`
- `D3Funding#borrow()`
- `D3Funding#repay()`
- `D3Funding#repayAll()`
- `D3Funding#makerDeposit()`
- `D3Funding#makerWithdraw()`
- `D3Funding#checkCanBeLiquidated()`
- `D3Funding#checkBorrowSafe()`
- `D3VaultLiquidation#startLiquidation()`
- `D3VaultLiquidation#liquidate()`
- `D3VaultLiquidation#finishLiquidation()`

The critical functions of the whole protocol may be unavailable due to block gas limit:

- User can not sell or buy tokens from pool
- Pool can not borrow tokens from vault
- Pool can not repay or repay all tokens to vault
- No one can call `D3Funding#makerDeposit()` successfully after transferring tokens to pool
- Maker can not withdraw tokens from pool
- DODO team can not liquidate pool even it is eligible to be liquidated.
- No one cal call `D3VaultLiquidation#liquidate()` to liquidate pool even it is eligible.


Since there is no way to remove new added `token` from `tokenList` in vault, the whole protocol can not be recovered to normal status.

The owner of the vault can call `D3Vault#pendingRemovePoolRepayAll()` to force pool repay all debt if the balance is no less than the debt, but the pool is no longer available.
