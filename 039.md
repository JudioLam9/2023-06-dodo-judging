# heartbeat issues for chainlink

## Summary
 On Arbitrum, as well as pretty much any other network, different token pairs have different heartbeats. 

## Vulnerability Detail
using the same heartbeat for all feeds is highly dangerous especially when the feed is a chainlink feed

The issue with this is that the [USDC/USD](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/usdc-usd) oracle has a 24 hour heartbeat, whereas the [average](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd) has a heartbeat of 1 hour. Since they use the same heartbeat the heartbeat needs to be slower of the two or else the contract would be nonfunctional most of the time. The issue is that it would allow the consumption of potentially very stale data from the non-USDC feed.


 If the oracle gets the latest price for two pairs with different heartbeats, using the same heartbeat variable for validation would cause either one of the following:

1. Oracle will be down (will revert) most of the time.

2. Oracle will allow for stale prices

When validating prices for two different token pairs, two different heartbeats must be used.

## Impact

1. Oracle will be down (will revert) most of the time.

2. Oracle will allow for stale prices
