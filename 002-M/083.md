# Liquidation and borrowing process would be broken for some ERC20

## Summary
Because of how the contract is using the `approve` function in multiple functions in D3Pool, there are cases of ERC20 where `approve` would revert and the whole liquidation process would break
## Vulnerability Detail
The D3Pool can borrow assets from the D3Vault by calling the `borrow` function which would set the allowance of the borrowed token to `type(uint256).max` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Pool/D3Funding.sol#L20-L23 so in case of liquidation the D3Vault can `transferFrom` the pool the amount liquidated. The problem relies in the cases where some ERC20 tokens needs to be approved to 0 first, before changing the allowance, to mitigate the race condition known in the basic approve function, one such example is USDT, the stable coin with the biggest market cap

In the case of USDT the D3Pool would borrow from the D3Vault the `amount` of USDT and then it would set the allowance to `type(uint256).max`, but in the case of liquidation the D3Vault calls `updateReserveByVault` , in both `liquidate` and `liquidateByDODO` functions which will set the allowance to `type(uint256).max` again https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Pool/D3Funding.sol#L49-L55
but this time the `approve` function would revert all the time since it tries to change from a non-zero value to another non-zero value, making the liquidation process impossible
## Impact
This is a high severity because in the cases of those token the whole functionality of the protocol  would be broken

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The best recommendation would be to use the `safeApprove` from OpenZeppelin that takes cares of the cases where it needs to approve to 0 first, if you try to approve to 0 by yourself first consider that this would break the functionality of the protocol with other ERC20 that don't let the `value` of `approve` to be 0, like BNB on Ethereum mainnet
