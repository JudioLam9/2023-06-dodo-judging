# D3Fundingpool will not work as intended for Tokens with Approval Race Condition check


## Summary

Several functions in D3FundingPool with revert, if called for a token with `Approval Race Condition protection` (like USDT), and a leftover allowance.

## Vulnerability Detail

Several functions in D3Funding.sol check for the allowance of the Vault for the corresponsing token. If the allowance is lower than the maximum allowance, a new allowance is set to the maximum amount `type(uint256).max`. This is a problem for tokens, whcih are implementing an `Approval Race COndition protection` that requires the allowance to be reset to `0` before giving a new allowance, if there is already an existing allowance. (e.g. USDT).
If there is a leftover allowance, which will probably become the case, all these functions will revert, as they try to set a new allowance.
Namely these functions are:
- borrow
- updateReserveByVault
- makerDeposit


## Impact

Core Contract features are blocked, because they will revert for Tokens wih `Approval Race Condition protection`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Reset the allowance to 0 first before giving a new allowance, to prevent the call from reverting.
- Ideally the allowance would only be given for the required amount, instead of the max amount.
