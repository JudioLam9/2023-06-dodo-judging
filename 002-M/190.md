# Accounting records will not be updated correctly if the pool fails to transfer the full outstanding borrow balance

## Summary
The poolRepay only checks if the provided repayment amount is less than or equal to the total borrow balance (borrows) for the given token. It does not verify whether the transfer of tokens from the pool to the vault actually succeeds.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the poolRepay function, the amount parameter specifies the amount of tokens that the pool intends to repay. The function attempts to transfer the specified amount of tokens from the pool to the vault using the safeTransferFrom function of the ERC20 token contract. However, if the safeTransferFrom function fails, for example, due to insufficient token balance or a transfer error, the function will still update the storage variables, reducing the record.amount, info.totalBorrows, and increasing info.balance, assuming the transfer was successful.
## Impact
If the transfer fails, the outstanding borrow balance will not be fully repaid, resulting in an incorrect borrow balance in the pool and a loss of funds for the vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add explicit check to ensure the successful completion of the transfer before updating the borrow records and balances
