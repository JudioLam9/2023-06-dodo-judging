# malicious user can drain funds from vault

## Summary

Certain tokens, like USDT & BNB, don't revert on failure and instead return a bool. In `D3LiquidationVault.sol.liquidate` the use of `transferFrom` without ensuring its success will allow a user to steal funds from the vault & cause it to enter an unhealthy state.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user calls `liquidate`  the following transfer is done:

```solidity
IERC20(debt).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), debtToCover);
```

The issue is, depending on the token `debt`, it may return a `bool` instead of reverting. However, as it is not checked here, the function still continues without the vault receiving the corresponding tokens. 

This is problematic for a `pool` contract as the following updates to the state are made:

```solidity
BorrowRecord storage record = info.borrowRecord[pool];

...

record.amount = borrows - debtToCover;

...

IERC20(collateral).transferFrom(pool, msg.sender, collateralAmount);
```

## Impact

This means a thief can:

1. identify an asset in a `pool` that they know won't revert on transfer failure. 
2. once this asset can be liquidated, they can `liquidate` and specify `collateralAmount` which is the number of tokens they will receive from the vault for this liquidation
3. the thief will then receive `collateral` without losing `debt`
