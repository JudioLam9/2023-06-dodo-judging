# The pool can  borrow more tokens than the available quota.

## Summary
The getPoolLeftQuota function calculates the remaining borrowing quota for a given pool and token without verifying whether the pool has sufficient quota remaining to borrow more tokens. This could lead to a vulnerability that allows the pool to borrow more tokens than it should, potentially leading to insolvency or overloading the system.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function uses ID3PoolQuota(_POOL_QUOTA_).getPoolQuota to get the total borrowing quota allowed for the pool and token combination.
It then calculates the used quota by the pool by using the stored interestIndex and calling the internal _accrueInterestForRead function to get the current interestIndex. The interestIndex is used to calculate the total borrowed amount based on the historical borrowed amount.
The function computes the remaining quota by subtracting the used quota from the total quota. However, there is no explicit check to ensure that the remaining quota is not negative, which means the pool borrows tokens beyond its allocated limit

## Impact
A pool borrows tokens without checking its available quota.
The borrowed amount exceeds the available quota, leading to an over-borrowing situation.
The contract doesn't revert the transaction, allowing the pool to successfully borrow more tokens than allowed.
The over-borrowed tokens might not be backed by sufficient collateral in the pool, leading to a situation where the pool becomes under-collateralized.
If the borrowed tokens lose value (e.g., due to market fluctuations), the pool may not be able to repay the debt and become insolvent.
In such a scenario, Users who deposited their funds to earn interest might face losses.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a verification to ensure that the remaining quota is non-negative before proceeding with the borrow operation. This could be achieved by adding a simple require statement to check that the remaining quota is greater than or equal to zero:
