# insufficient validation can lead to loss of funds for user

## Summary

In `D3Proxy` the user essentially swaps tokens using `sellTokens`. However, this function doesn't validate the case where a user sends `msg.value` but doesn't specify ETH/Native address. This lack of validation doesn't protect the user from front-end errors that may supply incorrect values or from their own accidental misconfiguration.

This loss of funds may be significant and they should be protected from this risk.

## Vulnerability Detail

[D3Proxy.sol#L80-L101](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/periphery/D3Proxy.sol#L80-L101)

```solidity
function sellTokens(
        address pool,
        address to,
        address fromToken,
        address toToken,
        uint256 fromAmount,
        uint256 minReceiveAmount,
        bytes calldata data,
        uint256 deadLine
    ) public payable judgeExpired(deadLine) returns (uint256 receiveToAmount) {
        if (fromToken == _ETH_ADDRESS_) {
            require(msg.value == fromAmount, "D3PROXY_VALUE_INVALID");
            receiveToAmount = ID3MM(pool).sellToken(to, _WETH_, toToken, fromAmount, minReceiveAmount, data);
        } else if (toToken == _ETH_ADDRESS_) {
            receiveToAmount =
                ID3MM(pool).sellToken(address(this), fromToken, _WETH_, fromAmount, minReceiveAmount, data);
            _withdrawWETH(to, receiveToAmount);
            // multicall withdraw weth to user
        } else {
            receiveToAmount = ID3MM(pool).sellToken(to, fromToken, toToken, fromAmount, minReceiveAmount, data);
        }
    }
```

This function considers 3 cases:

1. `fromToken` == ETH_ADDRESS meaning the user wants to deposit ETH/Native in exchange for another token. In this case, they are expected to provide `msg.value` equal to the number of tokens they are sending `fromAmount`
2 & 3. `fromToken` != ETH_ADDRESS meaning the user wants to deposit an ERC20 token for another ERC20 token or ETH/Native

In cases 2&3 the user it is assumed that the user is not sending any `msg.value` however this is not enforced. As the `sellToken` function is payable the user is able to send any `msg.value` which will be lost in these cases. 

## Impact

Lack of protection for user loss of funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

in case 2&3 the following check should be done `if (msg.value != 0) revert()`
