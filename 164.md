# The use of the `liquidate` function in the `D3VaultLiquidation.sol` contract can result in substantial financial losses for the liquidator.

## Summary
The public `liquidate` function in the `D3VaultLiquidation.sol` contract may result in a lower `collateralAmount` for the liquidator than what he should actually receive, potentially causing financial losses.
## Vulnerability Detail
Within the `liquidate` function of the `D3VaultLiquidation.sol` contract, the liquidator is intended to receive a  `collateralAmountMax` in exchange for the `debtToCover` amount they transfer. However, there is a discrepancy where the liquidator actually receives a  `collateralAmount` instead. The specified `collateralAmount` parameter supposed to serve as a means of controlling slippage. If the liquidator should be entitled to an amount greater than the specified `collateralAmount`, denoted as `collateralAmountMax`, the difference between the expected and received amounts results in a loss of funds for the liquidator, specifically equivalent to `collateralAmountMax - collateralAmount`.
## Impact
The liquidator runs the risk of receiving less funds than they should actually obtain.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Transfer the corresponding collateral for the `debtToCover` if `collateralAmountMax` exceeds `collateralAmount` to avoid potential loss.
