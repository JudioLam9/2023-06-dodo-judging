# Malicious user can prevent DODO from finishing a liquidation

## Summary
A malicious user can frontrun calls from DODO to `finishLiquidation`, during which they send supported ERC20 tokens to the pool and cause the `finishLiquidation` call to fail in a normal liquidation scenario. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When a pool has bad debt the pool is able to be liquidated by DODO. This involves a series of calls:
1. `startLiquidation`
2. `liquidateByDODO`
3. `finishLiquidation`

During step 1 a liquidation target is set for each token:

```solidity
        for (uint256 i; i < tokenList.length; i++) {
            address token = tokenList[i];
            AssetInfo storage info = assetInfo[token];
            BorrowRecord storage record = info.borrowRecord[pool];
            uint256 debt = record.amount.div(record.interestIndex == 0 ? 1e18 : record.interestIndex).mul(info.borrowIndex).mul(ratio);
            liquidationTarget[pool][token] = debt;
        }
```

The liquidation target is 0 for tokens that have not been borrowed by the pool and non-zero for tokens that have been borrowed.

Step 2 of the above list is where DODO actually performs the liquidation step for each relevant token. Finally in step3 the liquidation is finished and any debt from the liquidation is repaid and the `totalBorrows` amount written down. During this `finishLiquidation` call the following logic is performed for each token:

```solidity
            uint256 balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(pool);
            uint256 debt = liquidationTarget[pool][token];
            int256 difference = int256(balance) - int256(debt);
            if (difference > 0) {
                require(!hasNegativeBalance, Errors.LIQUIDATION_NOT_DONE);
                hasPositiveBalance = true;
            } else if (difference < 0) {
                require(!hasPositiveBalance, Errors.LIQUIDATION_NOT_DONE);
                hasNegativeBalance = true;
                debt = balance; // if balance is less than target amount, just repay with balance
            }
```

As is also demonstrated in the associated tests, during the liquidation of the pool the normal behaviour would be to have some slippage, but still have the "in token" value to be greater than 95% of the "out token" value. In this case where value x is 95 < x < 100, the `difference` value in the above logic is < 0. Now, if `difference > 0` for any other token then the execution will revert.

A malicious user can use this to their advantage by simply transferring an arbitrary amount of any other supported ERC20 token to the pool to create a token where `balance > debt`. In fact this can be demonstrated with a very small change to an existing test:

```diff
diff --git a/new-dodo-v3/test/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultLiquidation.t.sol b/new-dodo-v3/test/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultLiquidation.t.sol

-        token1.mint(address(d3MM), 1);
+        token1.mint(user1, 10 ether);
+        vm.prank(user1);
+        token1.transfer(address(d3MM), 1);
         
         vm.prank(liquidator);
         d3Vault.startLiquidation(address(d3MM));

```

DODO could eventually finish the liquidation by ensuring that the `difference` was positive for every token, however this would involve having a slippage > 100 where you're effectively paying a premium for every token. In reality this premium would be negligible, so the main issue for DODO is the increase in time and gas to finish a liquidation.

## Impact
A malicious user can temporarily prevent DODO from finishing a liquidation, trapping funds that should be in the vault in a pool instead (so the funds cannot be used by other pools). The user could specifically frontrun `finishLiquidation` calls to gas grief DODO and depending on the number of supported ERC20 tokens they could repeat this attack multiple times. 

During this process `totalBorrows` is also greater than it should be, so LPs are earning more interest than they should be (which negatively impacts the last redeemer of pTokens).

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Because the `liquidateByDODO` method includes a call to update the reserves of the pool for both the "to" and "from" token, the following line in `finishLiquidation` should be changed from:

```solidity
uint256 balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(pool);
```

to:

```solidity
uint256 balance = ID3MM(pool).getTokenReserve(token);
```
