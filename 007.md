# Incorrect Order of Operations, Multiplication is being performed on the result of Division

## Summary
The provided code snippet is a part of the D3VaultFunding contract, responsible for managing funds within a vault system. The specific function _poolRepayAll is intended to repay the entire borrowed amount for a particular pool and token. However, there is an issue with the order of operations in the calculation of the amount variable.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the incorrect order of operations when calculating the amount variable. The code currently divides record.amount by record.interestIndex and then multiplies the result by info.borrowIndex. This can lead to precision loss and incorrect calculations. [function **_poolRepayAll**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/a8d30e611acc9762029f8756d6a5b81825faf348/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultFunding.sol#L117)


## Impact
The impact of the vulnerability could be as follows:

- **Precision Loss**: Performing the division before the multiplication may result in a loss of precision, leading to imprecise calculations and potential rounding errors.
- **Incorrect Amount Calculation**: The incorrect order of operations could result in an incorrect value for the amount variable. This can have ramifications on repayments and other related calculations within the contract.
- **Contract Behavior**: Using an incorrect amount value in subsequent operations or calculations could lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect balances, and incorrect state changes within the contract.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
 function _poolRepayAll(address pool, address token) internal {
        accrueInterest(token);

        AssetInfo storage info = assetInfo[token];
        BorrowRecord storage record = info.borrowRecord[pool];
        uint256 amount = record.amount.div(record.interestIndex == 0 ? 1e18 : record.interestIndex).mul(info.borrowIndex);

        uint256 interests = amount;

        record.amount = 0;
        record.interestIndex = info.borrowIndex;
        info.totalBorrows = info.totalBorrows - amount;
        info.balance = info.balance - amount;
        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(pool, address(this), amount);

        emit PoolRepay(pool, token, amount, interests);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review and Foundry test

## Recommendation
To address the vulnerability, it is recommended to adjust the order of operations in the calculation of the amount variable. The multiplication should be performed before the division to maintain precision and ensure accurate calculations. The corrected code snippet is as follows:
```solidity
uint256 amount = record.amount.mul(info.borrowIndex).div(record.interestIndex == 0 ? 1e18 : record.interestIndex);
```
By making this adjustment, the code will calculate the amount correctly, minimizing the risk of precision loss and ensuring accurate repayments and related calculations.
