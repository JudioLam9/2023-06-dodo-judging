# User quota usage is incorrectly calculated by fetching the wrong exchange rate

## Summary
In calls to `getUserQuota` the USD value of tokens deposited in the vault by a user is calculated. However during the the conversion from `pToken` balance to underlying ERC20 token balance, the wrong exchange rate is used.

## Vulnerability Detail
To calculate the USD value of a user deposit the following steps should be taken:
1. The user balance of the relevant pToken should be fetched
2. This balance is multiplied by the exchange rate for that pToken to the underlying ERC20 token
3. This value is multiplied by the USD price of the token

As can be seen from the following snippet, this process is loosely followed:

```solidity
    function getUserQuota(address user, address token) public view override returns (uint256) {
        //Query used quota
        //tokenlist useraddress get user usd quota
        uint256 usedQuota = 0;
        uint8 tokenDecimals = IERC20(token).decimals();
        address[] memory tokenList = d3Vault.getTokenList();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenList.length; i++) {
            address _token = tokenList[i];
            (address assetDToken,,,,,,,,,,) = d3Vault.getAssetInfo(_token);
            uint256 tokenBalance = IERC20(assetDToken).balanceOf(user);
            if (tokenBalance > 0) {
                tokenBalance = tokenBalance.mul(d3Vault.getExchangeRate(token));
                (uint256 tokenPrice, uint8 priceDecimal) = ID3Oracle(d3Vault._ORACLE_()).getOriginalPrice(_token);
                usedQuota = usedQuota + tokenBalance * tokenPrice / 10 ** (priceDecimal+tokenDecimals);
            }
        }
```

However, the problem with this code is that the wrong exchange rate is fetched from the vault. Specifically, `token` is used rather than `_token` during the iterations of the for loop.

## Impact
The impact of this bug is that the used quota calculated by any calls to `getUserQuota` varies depending on the token address provided as an input parameter. Therefore, the quota allowance of a user for 2 tokens that have the same quota will actually differ depending on the exchange rate of the token in question.

No funds are lost directly, but a user could order deposits to profit from the incorrect exchange rate value being used. I have submitted another report of a larger underlying issue regarding user quotas that will fix the ordering issue.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the relevant line to use `_token` rather than `token`:

```solidity
tokenBalance = tokenBalance.mul(d3Vault.getExchangeRate(_token));
```
