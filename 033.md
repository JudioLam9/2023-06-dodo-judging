# Inaccurate Quota Calculation in `getUserQuota` Function

## Summary
The `getUserQuota` function in the `D3UserQuota` contract is susceptible to precision loss during the calculation of the quota used by a user. This vulnerability arises from the use of floating-point division and multiplication operations without proper consideration for precision.
## Vulnerability Detail
The calculation in the `getUserQuota` function multiplies the token balance in USD with the token price and divides it by 10 raised to the power of the sum of the price decimal and token decimals. This approach can result in precision loss due to the limitations of floating-point arithmetic.
## Impact
The precision loss vulnerability can lead to incorrect quota calculations, potentially allowing users to exceed their intended quota limits. It may result in unexpected behavior, inaccurate quota enforcement, and potential loss of funds if the quota system is designed to prevent excessive token deposits.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
 usedQuota = usedQuota + tokenBalance * tokenPrice / 10 ** (priceDecimal+tokenDecimals);
```

## Proof of Concept (PoC):
```solidity
uint256 tokenBalance = 100;
uint256 tokenPrice = 1.5;
uint8 priceDecimals = 8;
uint8 tokenDecimals = 18;

uint256 quotaUsed = (tokenBalance * tokenPrice) / (10 ** (priceDecimals + tokenDecimals));

```
In this example, the expected quota used should be 150 (100 * 1.5). However, due to precision loss, the actual result will be truncated or rounded, leading to an inaccurate value.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Utilize the imported `DecimalMath` library: Since the `DecimalMath` library has been imported, it is crucial to utilize its functions and operations specifically designed for decimal arithmetic. Incorporate the library's functionality into the relevant calculations to handle decimal arithmetic with higher precision and mitigate precision loss.
2. Scale values appropriately: Before performing arithmetic operations, ensure that decimal values are scaled appropriately. Multiply values by suitable scaling factors to increase precision and reduce the risk of precision loss during calculations.
3. Implement fixed-point arithmetic: Consider implementing custom fixed-point arithmetic techniques to handle decimal calculations with precision. Fixed-point arithmetic avoids the inherent precision loss of floating-point arithmetic and can provide more accurate results.
