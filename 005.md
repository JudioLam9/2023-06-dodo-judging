# ERC20 token transfers should check the return value

## Summary

ERC20 token transfer / transferFrom should check the return bool value, instead of assuming that if the transfer fails, ERC20 will revert the transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail

[EIP-20](https:eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) only specifies transfer/transferFrom returns a bool value, when transfer failure revert is not required.    
If DODOv3 does not check the transfer return value, a token transfer failure will be treated as success by default, resulting in a loss of funds.    

## Impact

DODOv3 use transfer/transferFrom without checking the return value in D3VaultLiquidation and D3MMLiquidationRouter.   
Since the liquidation consists of two tokens: collateral and debt. When one of the silences fails it will result in different situations:
- collateral transfer silent failure, evil users can liquidate accounts without transferring funds, creating a lot of bad debt in protocol
- debt transfer silent failure: the user is liquidated but the debt does not decrease. As the debt persists, the user's assets will eventually be liquidated to 0, causing significant losses to the user's assets.
