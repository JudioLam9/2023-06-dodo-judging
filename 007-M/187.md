# Liquidations will be `frozen`, when the oracle go `offline` or a token's price dropping to `zero`

## Summary
In a rare scenario where the oracle goes offline or a token's price drops to zero liquidation will be impossible.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a liquidator or the DODO team wants to `liquidate()/liquidateByDODO()` a pool the call `ID3Oracle(_ORACLE_).getPrice` is used to retrieve important prices used for calculations to ensure correct liquidation. 
If this call to the oracle is corrupted due to it being offline/paused, the `liquidate()` function will revert. Moreover, if the price is returning 0 it will also revert because `(price > 0, "Chainlink: Incorrect Price");` 
A similar issue also occurred in the Iron Bank Protocol [for reference](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ironbank-judging/issues/433)
## Impact
 There is a risk that liquidations may not be feasible when they are most needed by the protocol, this may potentially push the protocol into insolvency.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
One way to address this potential risk is to put in place a precautionary step. For instance, you can surround the Oracle get price function with a try-catch block to ensure protection. Include alternative steps to handle situations where access to the Chainlink Oracle data feed is not granted. or a secondary oracle could be utilised as a backup plan.
