# Title: Potential Variance in Token Amounts Received during Trades

## Summary
 The smart contract allows users to buy and sell tokens, but there is a possibility of users receiving different token amounts than expected. This variance introduces uncertainty and potential financial implications for users.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue stems from the implementation of the `sellToken` and `buyToken` functions in the contract. The calculations for determining the token amounts to be received may not always align precisely with the user's expectations due to factors such as slippage and the deduction of swap fees. This can result in users receiving more or fewer tokens than they anticipated.
## Impact
1. Financial Losses: Users may experience unexpected financial losses if they sell tokens and receive a significantly lower amount than expected or buy tokens and end up paying more than anticipated.
2. Unpredictability: The variation in token amounts received makes it difficult for users to accurately predict the outcome of their trades, leading to reduced confidence in the trading mechanism.
3. User Trust: Inconsistent trading outcomes undermine user trust in the platform's integrity, potentially resulting in a negative user experience and reduced participation.

## Proof of Concept (PoC):
Perform a trade where a user sells a significant amount of tokens and receives a substantially lower token amount than expected.
Perform a trade where a user buys tokens and ends up paying more than the expected amount, receiving a lower token amount than anticipated.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Transparency and Information:
Clearly communicate to users the possibility of variance in token amounts due to factors like slippage and swap fees.
2. Educational Resources:
- Develop educational materials and resources to help users understand the risks and considerations involved in trading on the platform.
- Explain concepts like slippage, fees, and how they can affect trade outcomes.
3. Improved Pricing Mechanism:
- Implement mechanisms to minimize slippage and provide more accurate pricing for trades.
