# Incorrectly updated balance in _poolRepayAll() function

## Summary
`_poolRepayAll()` function is used either to repay all pool's borrows in a single transaction or during the pool removing process, as stated in the [comments](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3Vault.sol#L33). However, the function itself instead of adding the repaid amount to the vault's token balance subtracts it, breaking the vault's internal business logic.
## Vulnerability Detail
See the summary
## Impact
One of the impact is that the next depositor would receive a larger amount of dTokens, since it is calculated as the real balance of the Vault minus the internal balance, divided by the exchange rate.
