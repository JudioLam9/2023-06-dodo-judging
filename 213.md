# The pool attempts to repay more than it has actually borrowed.

## Summary
In the poolRepayAll function, the call to _poolRepayAll is internal, and it is expected that the pool contract (the msg.sender) will call this function. The _poolRepayAll function accrues interest for the specified token and then retrieves the amount borrowed by the pool by calculating it based on the stored borrow amount, interest index, and the current borrow index.
However, there is no explicit check to ensure that the amount to be repaid (amount = record.amount.div(record.interestIndex == 0 ? 1e18 : record.interestIndex).mul(info.borrowIndex);) is less than or equal to the actual borrowed amount (borrows). 
## Vulnerability Detail
The poolRepayAll function is called to repay all the borrowed amount by a specific pool.
The function retrieves the borrowed amount from the BorrowRecord storage for the pool.
It calculates the actual amount to repay by dividing the borrowed amount by the interest index and multiplying it by the borrow index.
The function subtracts the calculated amount from the totalBorrows and adds it back to the balance of the token.
The function transfers the tokens from the pool to the vault contract using safeTransferFrom.
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the function assumes the pool has enough tokens to repay the calculated amount without performing explicit checks. If the pool doesn't have enough tokens, the transfer will fail, and the state of the contract will be inconsistent

## Impact
1. If the pool fails to repay the full borrowed amount due to insufficient tokens, the lenders (LP users) may not receive their full interest or principal amount back, resulting in potential losses for the LP users.
2. If the pool does not have enough tokens to cover the total borrowed amount for the specific token, the contract will not detect this condition and will still attempt to repay the entire borrowed amount. This can result in a situation where the pool's token balance becomes negative or insufficient, leading to incorrect accounting and possible loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a check in the _poolRepayAll function to ensure that the amount to be repaid is not greater than the actual borrowed amount. This can be done by comparing amount with borrows and revert the transaction if amount exceeds borrows
