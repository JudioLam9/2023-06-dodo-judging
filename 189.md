# The pool can borrow more tokens than the vault actually holds

## Summary
poolBorrow is used by D3Pools to borrow funds from the vault to perform market activities. However, it does not check whether the vault has enough token balance to satisfy the borrow request. The code only checks the pool's available quota and the amount of funds already borrowed by the pool against the quota.
## Vulnerability Detail
This creates a vulnerability where a pool can potentially borrow more than what the vault holds, leading to a situation where the vault's balance becomes negative. Such an occurrence could severely impact the stability of the entire system, causing losses to other users who have deposited funds into the vault or causing unexpected behaviors in other parts of the protocol.
## Impact
An attacker or malicious user can manipulate the borrow records and potentially borrow more tokens than what the vault actually holds, leading to a loss of funds for the vault and potentially disrupting the functioning of the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the function with some additions whereby  the availableBalance variable is calculated as the difference between the vault's token balance (info.balance) and the borrowed amount (amount). The check require(availableBalance >= info.totalBorrows) ensures that the available balance in the vault is greater than or equal to the total borrowed amount. If the check fails, it will revert the transaction with an error message indicating insufficient token balance in the vault.
