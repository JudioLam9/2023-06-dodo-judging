# ```function burn``` does not factor in locked tokens for D3Tokens

## Summary
When LP deposit token into D3MM pool, they receive certain amount of corresponding D3Token. This D3Token has a mapping to signify locked tokens
```solidity
    mapping(address => uint256) private _locked;
```
This locked tokens are factored in for transfer and transferFrom functions

However, there is a bug in the burn function implemented here. 
```solidity
    /// @notice Burn certain amount of token on user account
    //@audit-issue when burning, it should factor in the locked tokens
    function burn(address user, uint256 value) external onlyOwner {
        _burn(user, value);
        emit Burn(user, value);
    }

```

## Vulnerability Detail
The burn function does not calculated, subtract or modify the locked token for a user. This here is a bug in the code.
This burn function removes the amount from the total balance of the user, i.e Locked+Unlocked balance. Therefore it can burn a users locked balance. 
Taking it further, it will DOS all user transactions in the future if the locked balance which has already been burnt is greater than any D3 tokens the address gets in the future. 

- EXPLANATION POC

1. A user deposits 100 usdt through ```D3Vault.userDeposit``` 
2. Assume the user receives 100 d3_usdt
3. User locks 80 of the d3_usdt tokens
4. User tries to withdraw 100 usdt through ```D3Vault.userWithdraw```
5. Transaction will succeed 
6. Same user deposits another 50 usdt and receives 50 d3_usdt
7. User tries to transfer to a new wallet but the transfer reverts because locked tokens is still set to 80

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Locked tokens should not be withdrawable, hence should not be burnable. 
Therefore amount should be checked against the locked tokens
```solidity
  function burn(address user, uint256 value) external onlyOwner {
        if(value > balanceOf(user) - _locked[user]) revert("BALANCE_NOT_ENOUGH");
        _burn(user, value);
        emit Burn(user, value);
    }
```
 If locked tokens are later decided upon as withdrawable then the locked tokens should be decremented to prevent DOS
```solidity
    function burn(address user, uint256 value) external onlyOwner {
        if(value > balanceOf(user) - _locked[user]) { 
        uint reminder = value - balanceOf(user);
        _locked[user]-= reminder;
        }
        _burn(user, value);
        emit Burn(user, value);
    }
```
