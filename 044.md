# No slippage or deadline control for user initiated liquidations

## Summary
No slippage or deadline control for calls to `liquidate` can result in a net loss for the caller.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user calls `liquidate` to liquidate a pool, they specify the debt that they would like to cover and the collateralAmount they would like to claim:

```solidity
    function liquidate(
        address pool,
        address collateral,
        uint256 collateralAmount,
        address debt,
        uint256 debtToCover
    ) external nonReentrant
``` 

Besides the checks that the collateral token is a positive net worth asset and the debt token is a negative net worth asset, there are only 2 checks for those user provided parameters:

```solidity
require(collateralAmount <= collateralAmountMax, Errors.COLLATERAL_AMOUNT_EXCEED);
require(debtToCover <= borrows, Errors.DEBT_TO_COVER_EXCEED);
```

The debt covered needs to be less than the borrow quantity of that token, and the collateral amount needs to be less than the max claimable amount given the quantity of debt tokens being covered, where:

```solidity
uint256 collateralAmountMax = debtToCover.mul(debtTokenPrice).div(collateralTokenPrice.mul(DISCOUNT));
```

Therefore, if the debt token price were to increase or the collateral token price were to decrease then `collateralAmountMax` increases. A normal incentivised user would be aiming to claim as much collateral as possible to make a profit from the liquidate call.

Mempool congestion or extreme token price movements could result in the user paying off a greater value of debt than the value of the collateral that they are claiming for.

## Impact
When a user calls `liquidate`, they do so with the intention of making a profit; this is how they are incentivised to pay the gas costs associated with the call. However the user could experience unintended slippage and end up making a loss on the liquidation.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `liquidate` function should have the ability to specify a deadline by which the transaction should be included on-chain and a slippage tolerance on the specified `collateralAmount`.
