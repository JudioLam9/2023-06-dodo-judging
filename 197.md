# Unsafe Down Cast of  token Index

## Summary
when casting to a lower unit, from a higher one it would lead to a silent overflow.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the setNewToken() function, the tokenIndex variable is initialized via uint256.
```solidity
        uint256 tokenIndex;
```
and after being calculated, it is downcated to uint8.
```solidity
 state.tokenMMInfoMap[token].tokenIndex = uint8(tokenIndex);
```
where the value of the tokenIndex calculated is greater than uint8 it will lead to an overflow.
## Impact
When an Overflow happens to the value stored, the  `state.tokenMMInfoMap[token].tokenIndex` will be wrong leading to wrong calculations in the future, when getting the token price or amounts, also will lead to accounting issues in D3Maker.sol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use safeCast Library to do casting to prevent overflow.
