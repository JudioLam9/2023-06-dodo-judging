# In file D3Proxy.sol, the validation of dToken is not checked and the fake dToken could be deposited to D3Vault.

Issue 5
## Summary
In file D3Proxy.sol, the validation of dToken is not checked and the fake dToken could be deposited to D3Vault.

## Level
Critical

## Vulnerability Detail
The input dToken is not checked whether it is owned by the input token.

## Impact
The attacker's actions might be as follows.
1. Generate some of dToken by calling createDToken function with the already registered valid token ( using addNewToken) and approve to a valid user.
2. In D3Proxy.sol, 
	2.1 the attacker could call userWithdraw function with the valid token and fake dToken and the amount value is small than token's dToken amount.
	2.2 _deposit function will deposit the fake dToken to D3Vault .
	2.3. D3Vault's userWithdraw function will be not reverted because the token is valid and dToken's amount is enough small.
As a result, some of the fake dToken will be deposited to vault but the real dToken's balance is not changed too.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
In file D3Proxy.sol, insert the following logic to line163
	if (token != _ETH_ADDRESS_) {
		(address assetDToken,,,,,,,,,,) = ID3Vault(_D3_VAULT_).getAssetInfo(token);
              	require(assetDToken == dToken, "DToken is invalid");
