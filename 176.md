# ETH stuck in proxy contract

## Summary
In the D3Proxy contract, there is a function   sellTokens, this function takes ETH and converts them to WETH if ETH is the ```fromToken``` however when ETH is not the from token, ETh can still be sent with the transaction however this ETH is lost to the user since it not used in the transaction and can be withdrawn by mev bots or any user.
## Vulnerability Detail
  ```solidity
  function sellTokens(
        address pool,
        address to,
        address fromToken,
        address toToken,
        uint256 fromAmount,
        uint256 minReceiveAmount,
        bytes calldata data,
        uint256 deadLine
    ) public payable judgeExpired(deadLine) returns (uint256 receiveToAmount) {
        if (fromToken == _ETH_ADDRESS_) {
            require(msg.value == fromAmount, "D3PROXY_VALUE_INVALID");
            receiveToAmount = ID3MM(pool).sellToken(to, _WETH_, toToken, fromAmount, minReceiveAmount, data);
        } else if (toToken == _ETH_ADDRESS_) {
         //@audit require msg.value == 0
            receiveToAmount =
                ID3MM(pool).sellToken(address(this), fromToken, _WETH_, fromAmount, minReceiveAmount, data);
            _withdrawWETH(to, receiveToAmount);
            // multicall withdraw weth to user
        } else {
            //@audit require msg.value == 0
            receiveToAmount = ID3MM(pool).sellToken(to, fromToken, toToken, fromAmount, minReceiveAmount, data);
        }
    }
```
In both the second and third statement, ETH should not be sent with the transaction, therefore it should revert to prevent loss to the users

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add require statements to prevent ETH values from being sent along with this transactions if the fromToken is not ETH. This protects the users
