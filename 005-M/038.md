# calculating `collateralAmountMax` is susceptible to precision loss due to division before multiplication

## Summary

Liquidations may be DOS due to division before multiplication

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `D3VaultLiquidation.liquidate` calculates the amount of accumulated debt `borrows` which acts as the upper limit of debt that can be repaid by the caller.

This is enforced with the following statement, where `debtToCover` is the number of tokens the caller wants to send to the contract to cover the debt.

```solidity
uint256 borrows = record.amount.div(record.interestIndex == 0 ? 1e18 : record.interestIndex).mul(info.borrowIndex);
require(debtToCover <= borrows, Errors.DEBT_TO_COVER_EXCEED);
```

However the calculation of `borrows` can result in precision loss, causing in a value of 0. This can occur if `record.amount < 1e18` or `record.amount < record.interestIndex`

## Impact

Liquidations for a pool will be DOS due to precision loss. Pool may enter an unrecoverable state
