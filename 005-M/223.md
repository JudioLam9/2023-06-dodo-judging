# Potential Precision Loss in `poolBorrow` function

## Summary
The function `poolBorrow` may suffer from potential precision loss due to the order of operations in the line `uint256 usedQuota = record.amount.div(oldInterestIndex).mul(currentInterestIndex);`. The division operation is performed before the multiplication, which can result in the truncation of decimal values and a loss of precision.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue arises from performing division before multiplication in the line `record.amount.div(oldInterestIndex).mul(currentInterestIndex)`. When dividing two integers in Solidity, the result is truncated towards zero, discarding any decimal portion. Subsequently, multiplying the truncated result by currentInterestIndex can further amplify the precision loss introduced by the division operation.

## Impact
The precision loss can lead to inaccurate calculations and unintended results.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To avoid potential precision loss, it is recommended to rearrange the operations and perform multiplication before division. The revised line of code should be:
```solidity
uint256 usedQuota = record.amount.mul(currentInterestIndex).div(oldInterestIndex);
```
