# D3Vault.sol `owner` not  explicitly set

## Summary
D3Vault.sol `owner` is not explicitly set in this contract or any other contract it inherits
## Vulnerability Detail
Since the contract never calls the Ownable.sol constructor _owner is never set and is left as address(0). This makes D3Vault.sol completely nonfunctional and disables the critical functions protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier.
```solidity
  constructor(address initialOwner) {
        _transferOwnership(initialOwner);
    }
```
## Impact
D3Vault.sol becomes completely nonfunctional and the `onlyOwner` modifier protected functions are disabled.
