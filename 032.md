# Title: Flawed Calculation Logic in `userDeposit` Function Allows Excess Funds Unreturned

## Summary
The `userDeposit` function in the codebase contains a flawed calculation logic that allows users to deposit more funds than required and receive an unintended amount of `dTokens` in return. This vulnerability poses a security concern as it can lead to economic imbalances, financial losses, and unfair advantages within the system.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue stems from the calculation logic within the `userDeposit` function. Specifically, the calculation of the corresponding amount of `dTokens` does not properly account for cases where users deposit more funds than necessary. As a result, users can unintentionally receive a different amount of `dTokens` than expected, leading to financial inconsistencies and unfair distribution of `dTokens`.
## Impact
1. Financial Losses: Users depositing more funds than necessary for the corresponding `dTokens` may incur financial losses if they receive a lesser amount of `dTokens` than expected based on their excess deposit.
2. User Dissatisfaction: Users who deposit more funds but receive a smaller amount of `dTokens` may become dissatisfied with the platform or service, leading to a negative user experience and potential loss of trust.
3. Inefficiency and Resource Misallocation: Excess funds that are not utilized for minting `dTokens` create inefficiencies and can result in the misallocation of resources within the system.
## Code Snippet

## Proof of Concept (PoC):
```solidity
function userDeposit(uint256 amount) public {
    uint256 exchangeRate = getExchangeRate();
    uint256 dTokensToMint = amount / exchangeRate;
    
    // Mint dTokens to the user
    dToken.mint(msg.sender, dTokensToMint);
    
    // Transfer the excess funds back to the user
    uint256 excessFunds = amount - (dTokensToMint * exchangeRate);
    msg.sender.transfer(excessFunds);
}
```
Suppose the current exchange rate is 10 tokens per `dToken`. A user deposits 150 tokens.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Validate the deposited amount: Before executing the minting process, validate the amount deposited by the user to ensure it is equal to or greater than the required amount based on the exchange rate. Reject any deposits below and more than the required threshold.
2. Adjust the calculation logic: Instead of relying solely on the division of the deposited amount by the exchange rate, consider using a modular operation (`amount % exchangeRate`) to calculate the excess funds. This will allow for accurate calculation of the corresponding `dTokens` and any excess amount.
3. Return excess funds to the user: Modify the code to transfer any excess funds back to the user after minting the corresponding `dTokens`. Calculate the excess funds as `excessFunds = amount - (dTokensToMint * exchangeRate)` and transfer it back to the user's account.
