# Unhandled chainlink revert would lock price oracle access

## Summary
Chainlink's latestRoundData() is used which could potentially revert and make it impossible to query any prices. This could lead to permanent denial of service.

## Vulnerability Detail
In D3Oracle.sol,

```Solidity
File: contracts/DODOV3MM/periphery/D3Oracle.sol

    function getPrice(address token) public view override returns (uint256) {
        require(priceSources[token].isWhitelisted, "INVALID_TOKEN");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(priceSources[token].oracle);
        (uint80 roundID, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        require(price > 0, "Chainlink: Incorrect Price");
        require(block.timestamp - updatedAt < priceSources[token].heartBeat, "Chainlink: Stale Price");
        require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Chainlink: Stale Price");
        return uint256(price) * 10 ** (36 - priceSources[token].priceDecimal - priceSources[token].tokenDecimal);
    }

    function getOriginalPrice(address token) public view override returns (uint256, uint8) {
        require(priceSources[token].isWhitelisted, "INVALID_TOKEN");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(priceSources[token].oracle);
        (uint80 roundID, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        require(price > 0, "Chainlink: Incorrect Price");
        require(block.timestamp - updatedAt < priceSources[token].heartBeat, "Chainlink: Stale Price");
        require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Chainlink: Stale Price");
        uint8 priceDecimal = priceSources[token].priceDecimal;
        return (uint256(price), priceDecimal);
    }
```

The above functions makes use of Chainlink's latestRoundData() to get the latest price. However, there is no fallback logic to be executed when the access to the Chainlink data feed is denied by Chainlink's multisigs. Chainlink's multisigs can immediately block access to price feeds at will. Therefore, to prevent denial of service scenarios, it is recommended to query Chainlink price feeds using a defensive approach with Solidityâ€™s try/catch structure. In this way, if the call to the price feed fails, the caller contract is still in control and can handle any errors safely and explicitly.

## Impact
Call to latestRoundData could potentially revert and make it impossible to query any prices. This could lead to permanent denial of service.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Surround the call to latestRoundData() with try/catch instead of calling it directly. In a scenario where the call reverts, the catch block can be used to call a fallback oracle or handle the error in any other suitable way.
