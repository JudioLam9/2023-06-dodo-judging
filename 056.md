# ` getFeeRate `  function does not â€˜check if contract implements in the ` IFeeRateModel `  interface.

## Summary
- This problem is caused by a typo in the `getFeeRate` function. The function is supposed to check to see if the contract at the `_FEE_RATE_MODEL_` address implements the `IFeeRateModel` interface, the typo has caused the function to check to see if the contract is a contract at all, rather than checking to see if it implements the `IFeeRateModel` interface
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function getFeeRate() external view returns(uint256 feeRate) {
        return IFeeRateModel(state._FEE_RATE_MODEL_).getFeeRate();
    }
```
- the problem is `getFeeRate` function is only checking the `_FEE_RATE_MODEL_` variable to see if it is a valid address., it is not checking to see if the contract at that address actually implements the `IFeeRateModel` interface. This means that it is possible for the contract to return a fee rate that is not valid, or even to throw an error.
## Impact
- This problem cause the contract to return an invalid fee rate, or even to throw an error

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- change the line 
`if (isContract(state._FEE_RATE_MODEL_)) ` to if `(IFeeRateModel(state._FEE_RATE_MODEL_).isInterface()) `. This will ensure that the function only returns a valid fee rate if the contract at the `_FEE_RATE_MODEL_ `  address implements the ` IFeeRateModel ` interface.
