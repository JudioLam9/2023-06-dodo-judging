# Removing pool doesn't work as documented when DODO is the liquidator

## Summary
When the owner of the vault removes a pool from the vault, if the pool does not have enough assets to repay all its borrows, it has to go through liquidation by DODO. The documented flow in this case doesn't work as intended.

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling `removeD3Pool` to remove a pool that doesn't have enough assets to repay all its borrows, the documented process is:

```solidity
    /// @notice removeD3Pool() -> liquidateByDODO() -> finishPoolRemove()
```

This is incorrect for a few reasons. Firstly `liquidateByDODO` doesn't update the accounting for the given token. As can be seen from the alternate route where `_poolRepayAll` is called, the borrow record should be updated, as should `AssetInfo` of the token. This does not occur in `liquidateByDODO`.

Thus, surely the obvious option is to call `finishLiquidation` to update the accounts of the pool and tokens? However this also leads to an incorrect accounting situation. The debt of the given pool and token is given by `liquidationTarget[pool][token]`, and is used heavily for calculations. However the above storage slot is 0 since this value is set by calls to`startLiquidation`.

So, to properly liquidate the pool during removal, `startLiquidation` should be called before `liquidateByDODO`, before finally `finishLiquidation`. However this isn't possible due to the following check in `startLiquidation`:

```solidity
require(!ID3MM(pool).isInLiquidation(), Errors.ALREADY_IN_LIQUIDATION);
```

This will always revert because `ID3MM(pool).startLiquidation();` is called in the `removeD3Pool` flow.

## Impact
Thus, the end result is there is currently no way for a pool to be properly removed when a pool doesn't have enough assets to repay all borrows.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the `ID3MM(pool).startLiquidation();` call from `removeD3Pool` and update the documentation to make it clear that the remove pool liquidation process by DODO is:

```solidity
/// @notice removeD3Pool() -> startLiquidation() -> liquidateByDODO() -> finishLiquidation() -> finishPoolRemove()
```
