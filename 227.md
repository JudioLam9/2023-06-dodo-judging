# Using unsafe ERC20 methods can revert the transaction for some tokens.

## Summary
Using unsafe ERC20 methods can revert the transaction for some tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
IERC20(collateral).transferFrom() and IERC20(debt).transferFrom() will fail for some tokens as they may not conform to the standard IERC20 interface. And liquidate() function in the D3VaultLiquidation contract use this unsafe method so when collateral is one of these tokens, the function will fail.

## Impact
The liquidate() function will fail for some tokens.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
IERC20(collateral).transferFrom(pool, msg.sender, collateralAmount);
IERC20(debt).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), debtToCover);
```
