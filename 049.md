# whenever PMMState.k is == 0, markPrice(PMMState.i) will divide 10**36 and be divided by 10**18, using mismatched precision will cause precision loss

## Summary
`10**18` and `10**36` will be used in calculating markPrice(PMMState.i) and this will affect `receiveToAmount` and `vusdAmount`
## Vulnerability Detail
PMMPricing._SellQuoteToken() uses 2 different decimals when calculating state.i(i.e markPrice) 
```solidity 
function _SellQuoteToken(//@audit-info called by _querySellQuoteToken() 
        PMMState memory state,
        uint256 payQuoteAmount
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 receiveBaseToken) {
        return DODOMath._SolveQuadraticFunctionForTrade(
            state.B0, state.B, payQuoteAmount, DecimalMath.reciprocalFloor(state.i), state.K
        );
    }
```

looking at the return statement
```solidity
 return DODOMath._SolveQuadraticFunctionForTrade(
            state.B0, state.B, payQuoteAmount, DecimalMath.reciprocalFloor(state.i), state.K
        );
```
you'll notice that  DODOMath._SolveQuadraticFunctionForTrade() is used for the calculation, but also you'll notice  `DecimalMath.reciprocalFloor(state.i)` as one of its params.

DecimalMath.reciprocalFloor(state.i) divides 10**36 by `state.i`(markPrice) 
```solidity
function reciprocalFloor(uint256 target) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        return uint256(10 ** 36) / target;
    }//@audit 10**36 / markPrice
```

and in DODOMath._SolveQuadraticFunctionForTrade() whenever state.k == 0,  DecimalMath.mulFloor()  will perform a calculation with result of DecimalMath.reciprocalFloor(state.i) which divides 10**36 by `state.i`(markPrice). [You'll see that here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/lib/DODOMath.sol#L82-L86)

Now lets take a look at  DecimalMath.mulFloor()
```solidity
function mulFloor(uint256 target, uint256 d) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        return target * d / (10 ** 18);
    }
```

now this call `DecimalMath.mulFloor(i, delta)` will do `state.i`(markPrice) `multiplied` with delta which is payQuoteAmount and then divide it by 10**18 which is a different decimal altogether.
```solidity
state.i(markPrice) * delta(payQuoteAmount) / 10**18
```
since 2 different decimals are used 10 ** 18 and 10 ** 36 it will result in a scenario where the products of the calculations returned in PMMPricing._SellQuoteToken() will be bigger than should be or smaller than should be.

The main issue here is that PMMPricing._SellQuoteToken() is used in function used to calculate `receiveToAmount` and `vusdAmount`

```solidity
 receiveVUSD = PMMPricing._querySellQuoteToken(fromTokenState, fromTokenAmount);
//@audit here 2 different decimals are used in calculating fromTokenAmount
```
and here
```solidity
     receiveToToken = PMMPricing._querySellQuoteToken(toTokenState, receiveVUSD);//@audit here also

```

## Impact
`10**18` and `10**36` will be used in calculating markPrice(PMMState.i) and this will affect `receiveToAmount` and `vusdAmount` resulting in s scenario where `receiveToAmount` and `vusdAmount` are bigger than they should be or lesser than they should be whenever state.K==0


The affected `receiveToAmount` is used here in D3Trading.sellToken to make a transfer to `to` address [see here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Pool/D3Trading.sol#L108)
```solidity

        _transferOut(to, toToken, receiveToAmount);

## Recommendation
Don't use conflicting decimals in calculations as it will cause precision loss
