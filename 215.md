# Missing checks for whether arbitrum, optimism or polygon Sequencer is active

## Summary

Missing checks for whether arbitrum, optimism or polygon (L2) Sequencer is active

## Vulnerability Detail

Chainlink recommends that users using price oracles, check whether the Arbitrum sequencer is active

https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#l2-sequencer-uptime-feeds

## Impact

Wrong valuation of debt, wrongly calculated possibility of liquidation, wrong value of a possible loan. All price-dependent functions will be at risk, because with high volatility of the asset in the market, the price may be out of date.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use sequencer oracle to determine whether the sequencer is offline or not. 
https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds

> To help your applications identify when the sequencer is unavailable, you can use a data feed that tracks the last known status of the sequencer at a given point in time. This helps you prevent mass liquidations by providing a grace period to allow customers to react to such an event.

As this requires reworking the contract specifically for individual networks, it will be best to make a variation of the `D3Oracle.sol` contract specifically for L2 networks, in which it will be checked whether the sequencer is "alive". Deployment of the relevant contract can be automated in the deployment script.
