# `D3MMLiquidationRouter` contract can lose all tokens causing by approving the maximum possible amount of tokens.

## Summary
- There tow issues that show in the code first in the approving maximum possible as show in the vulnerability details, and the second is in the  transfers all its balance.
## Vulnerability Detail
- The contract is approving the maximum possible amount of `order.fromToken` to `_DODO_APPROVE_`. If `_DODO_APPROVE_` is a malicious contract, it could drain all tokens from this contract.
```solidity
 function D3Callee(LiquidationOrder calldata order, address router, bytes calldata routeData) external {
        IERC20(order.fromToken).approve(_DODO_APPROVE_, type(uint256).max);
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = router.call(routeData);
        if (!success) {
            assembly {
                revert(add(data, 32), mload(data))
            }
        }
        IERC20(order.toToken).transfer(msg.sender, IERC20(order.toToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
}
```
-also  the contract transfers all its balance of `order.toToken` to `msg.sender`. If `msg.sender` is also a  contract which does not expect to receive tokens, the tokens could be lost forever.
## Impact
- so this is a poc that can be used :
MaliciousContract.sol
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.16;

contract MaliciousContract {
    function drain(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        require(to != address(0));
        require(amount > 0);

        IERC20(to).transfer(amount);
    }
}
```
- LostTokenContract.sol
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.16;

contract LostTokenContract {
    constructor() {}

    function receiveTokens(uint256 amount) public {
        // Do nothing with the tokens.
    }
}
```
- out put : because  the `LostTokenContract` contract does not do anything with the tokens that are transferred 
```solidity
The tokens have been lost forever
```
explaintaion:
    The D3MMLiquidationRouter contract is deployed.
    The MaliciousContract contract is deployed.
    The LostTokenContract contract is deployed.
    The D3MMLiquidationRouter contract is configured to approve the maximum possible amount of tokens to the MaliciousContract  
    contract.
    The MaliciousContract contract calls the D3Callee function of the D3MMLiquidationRouter contract.
    The D3MMLiquidationRouter contract calls the call function of the router contract.
    The router contract calls the transfer function of the LostTokenContract contract.
    The LostTokenContract contract does not do anything with the tokens.
    The tokens are lost forever.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-  Instead of approving the maximum amount,only approving the amount that is needed for the current operation.
- The `D3Callee` function should check to see if `msg.sender` is a contract. If `msg.sender` is a contract, the function should not transfer any tokens. Instead, the function should return an error."
