# Critical Vulnerability Unrestricted ETH and Token Deposit at the same time buyTokens

## Summary
The D3Proxy contract allows users to deposit both ETH and tokens simultaneously in the buyTokens function without properly validating the value of msg.value when token is not ETH. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential financial losses.

## Vulnerability Detail
The functions [buyTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/a8d30e611acc9762029f8756d6a5b81825faf348/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/periphery/D3Proxy.sol#L112) currently check if the token address is equal to ETH_ADDRESS, but they fail to verify that msg.value should not be send when token is not ETH. This allows users to deposit an incorrect amount of ETH and tokens, bypassing the expected payment validation.

## Impact
The vulnerability enables users to exploit the contract by depositing an incorrect amount of ETH and tokens simultaneously. This can result in inaccurate accounting of funds, incorrect token balances, and potential financial losses.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
 function buyTokens(
        address pool,
        address to,
        address fromToken,
        address toToken,
        uint256 quoteAmount,
        uint256 maxPayAmount,
        bytes calldata data,
        uint256 deadLine
    ) public payable judgeExpired(deadLine) returns (uint256 payFromAmount) {
        if (fromToken == _ETH_ADDRESS_) {
            payFromAmount = ID3MM(pool).buyToken(to, _WETH_, toToken, quoteAmount, maxPayAmount, data);
            // multicall refund eth to user
        } else if (toToken == _ETH_ADDRESS_) {
            payFromAmount = ID3MM(pool).buyToken(address(this), fromToken, _WETH_, quoteAmount, maxPayAmount, data);
            _withdrawWETH(to, quoteAmount);
            // multicall withdraw weth to user
        } else {
            payFromAmount = ID3MM(pool).buyToken(to, fromToken, toToken, quoteAmount, maxPayAmount, data);
        }
    }
```

## Tool used
Foundry and Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, update the buyTokens function to include proper validation of msg.value when token is not ETH_ADDRESS. Ensure that msg.value shouldn't be send, to prevent users from depositing an incorrect amount of ETH. This will help maintain the expected behavior of the contract and mitigate potential financial risks.

```solidity
 function buyTokens(
        address pool,
        address to,
        address fromToken,
        address toToken,
        uint256 quoteAmount,
        uint256 maxPayAmount,
        bytes calldata data,
        uint256 deadLine
    ) public payable judgeExpired(deadLine) returns (uint256 payFromAmount) {
        if (fromToken == _ETH_ADDRESS_) {
            payFromAmount = ID3MM(pool).buyToken(to, _WETH_, toToken, quoteAmount, maxPayAmount, data);
            // multicall refund eth to user
        } else if (toToken == _ETH_ADDRESS_) {
            payFromAmount = ID3MM(pool).buyToken(address(this), fromToken, _WETH_, quoteAmount, maxPayAmount, data);
            _withdrawWETH(to, quoteAmount);
            // multicall withdraw weth to user
        } else {
           require(msg.value == 0, "D3PROXY_PAYMENT_NOT_MATCH");
            payFromAmount = ID3MM(pool).buyToken(to, fromToken, toToken, quoteAmount, maxPayAmount, data);
        }
    }
```
