# Unsafe casting can cause an overflow while finishing liquidation

## Summary

Casting a `uint256` value to `int256` can cause an overflow. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In `D3VaultLiquidation.sol` function [`finishLiquidation`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultLiquidation.sol#L128) in L128 uses an unsafe cast, that can overflow.

## Impact

It can cause problems with finishing liquidation since the `difference` variable will be wrongly calculated.
Although not very likely, since there is a possibility it's better to mitigate it than not.

## Code Snippet
