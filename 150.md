# In `D3VaultLiquidation.sol` function `liquidate()` can be front run constantly

## Summary

Function `liquidate()` can be constantly front run since there is no variable indicating that the pool is being liquidated.

## Vulnerability Detail

`liquidate()` has a `require()` statement that [checks if a pool is in liquidation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultLiquidation.sol#L39), but does not set any variable to indicate that the pool is being liquidated.

```solidity
require(!ID3MM(pool).isInLiquidation(), Errors.ALREADY_IN_LIQUIDATION);
```

## Impact

 This can cause the liquidator to get front run constantly. Thus never allowing the liquidators to liquidate, but only front running bots will.

## Code Snippet

Function [`liquidate()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultLiquidation.sol#L30-L61)

## Tool used

Manuel Review

## Recommendation

Before other liquidate logic set a variable to indicate that the pool is being liquidated.
Like in function [`startLiquidation()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultLiquidation.sol#L70)

```solidity
ID3MM(pool).startLiquidation();
```
