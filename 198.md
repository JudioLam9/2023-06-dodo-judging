# Missing `Initializer` Modifier on the initialize Functions

## Summary
Certain initialize functions in some `DODO` contracts can be re-initialized due to missing `Initializer` modifiers on them, where those contracts make use of proxies that have to be initialized properly to avoid future re-initialization.
## Vulnerability Detail
In D3MM.sol you can see the -->
```solidity
    function init(
        address creator,
        address maker,
        address vault,
        address oracle,
        address feeRateModel,
        address maintainer
    ) external {
```
And the `D3Maker.sol`
```solidity
    function init(address owner, address pool, uint256 maxInterval) external {
        initOwner(owner);
        _POOL_ = pool;
        state.heartBeat.maxInterval = maxInterval;
    }
```
you can see here it doesn't have the `Initializer` modifier to avoid any future re-initialization

## Impact
contracts can be re - Initialized by an attacker with their own malicious contracts, and used to steal funds and disrupt the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Import Open Zeppenlines Initializable.sol and Use the `initializer` modifier on the functions meant for initialization in such contracts.
