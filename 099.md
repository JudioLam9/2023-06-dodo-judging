# Anyone can call `refundETH()` function in the `D3Proxy.sol` and drain the contract

## Summary
The `refundETH()` function doesn't have any access control. Anyone can call `refundETH()` function in the `D3Proxy.sol` and drain the contract

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability is caused by no access control check in the `refundETH()` function in `D3Proxy.sol` contract. You can see the code below:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/periphery/D3Proxy.sol#L188-L193

```solidity
    /// @dev when fromToken = ETH and call buyTokens, call this function to refund user's eth
    function refundETH() external payable {
        if (address(this).balance > 0) {
            _safeTransferETH(msg.sender, address(this).balance);
        }
    }
``` 

As you can see in the developer comment above the function, it is intended to be called inside the `buyTokens()` function when the fromToken == ETH. But unfortunately this function is **external** with no access control. 

## Impact
Anyone can drain the whole ether balance of the `D3Proxy.sol` contract.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/periphery/D3Proxy.sol#L188-L193

```solidity
    /// @dev when fromToken = ETH and call buyTokens, call this function to refund user's eth
    function refundETH() external payable {
        if (address(this).balance > 0) {
            _safeTransferETH(msg.sender, address(this).balance);
        }
    }
``` 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make the function internal or add access control depending on how to use it in the protocol.
