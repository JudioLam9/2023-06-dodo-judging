# stuart_the_minion - Need to check maximum value of numberOfStable and numberOfNS in D3Maker::setNewToken()

stuart_the_minion
medium

## Summary

If `numberOfNS` or `numberOfStable` of maker state exceeds 128, further tokens will start `allFlag` bit index from 0, and it will make cumulative values of further tokens totally messed.

## Vulnerability Detail

Each bit of `allFlag` in D3Storage represents cumulative status of the corresponding token.  Even index bit represents stable token while odd index bit represents non-stable one.
If either number of stable or non-stable tokens is greater than 128, the `allFlag` bit index will start from 0 again and first token and 129th token will conflict on `allFlag`.

## Impact

By this issue, selling or buying tokens will be affected. Actually, this issue is high risk but more than 128 tokens is a rare case, so I evaluate this as medium by myself.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add validation of number of tokens at the beginning of `D3Maker::setNewToken()` function

```solidity
if (stableOrNot)
    require(state.priceListInfo.numberOfStable < 128, "Number of stable tokens exceeded");
else
    require(state.priceListInfo.numberOfNS < 128, "Number of non-stable tokens exceeded");
```
