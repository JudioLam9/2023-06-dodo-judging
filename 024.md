# DOS ATTACK

## Summary

One of the functions is vulnerable to a DOS attack.

## Vulnerability Detail

The **accrueInterests** function is public and there are no additional gas or rate limiting mechanisms in place, it could potentially be vulnerable to abuse by someone calling it multiple times until the gas block is empty.

## Impact

When a function is marked as public, it can be called by anyone, including other contracts or external accounts. If there are no restrictions or conditions on the number of times the function can be called, an attacker could repeatedly invoke the **accrueInterests** function, consuming all available gas and potentially causing denial-of-service (DoS) issues.

## Code Snippet

Found in line 171 at 2023-06-dodo-souilos/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultFunding.sol:

```solidity
function accrueInterests() public {
        for (uint256 i; i < tokenList.length; i++) {
            address token = tokenList[i];
            accrueInterest(token);
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement suitable rate limiting mechanisms, such as setting a maximum number of calls within a specific time period or implementing access control modifiers to limit the execution of the function to authorized parties only.
