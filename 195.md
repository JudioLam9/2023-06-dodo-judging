# getPrice() and getOriginalPrice() doesn't check whether arbitrum sequencer is down

## Summary
Downtimes are common on L2s so it is important to validate if Arbitrum sequencer is operational before any state-changing operation occurs. This is to ensure that the prices are fresh and not stale.
## Vulnerability Detail
D3Oracle.getPrice() and D3Oracle.getOriginalPrice() functions don't check if Arbitrum sequencer is down.
## Impact
Stale prices would be used and might result in false liquidations.
