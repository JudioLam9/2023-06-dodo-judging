# In D3MMLiquidationRouter.sol, D3Callee() can silently fail if router is non-existent

## Summary
 In D3MMLiquidationRouter.sol, D3Callee() can silently fail if router is non-existent

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

In  D3MMLiquidationRouter.sol, D3Callee() has used low level .call function,

```solidity
File: contracts/DODOV3MM/periphery/D3MMLiquidationRouter.sol

23    function D3Callee(LiquidationOrder calldata order, address router, bytes calldata routeData) external {
24        IERC20(order.fromToken).approve(_DODO_APPROVE_, type(uint256).max);
25        (bool success, bytes memory data) = router.call(routeData);
26        if (!success) {
27            assembly {
28                revert(add(data, 32), mload(data))
29            }
30        }
31        IERC20(order.toToken).transfer(msg.sender, IERC20(order.toToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
32    }
```

The main issues is at L-25, It does not check the existence of router address and router address is a contract address or not. It does not have a validation check for address(0) for address token and such design pattern does not as per recommended solidity guidlines. 

[According to the Solidity documentation:](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions)

"The low-level functions call, delegatecall and staticcall return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed".

As a result, it is possible that this call() low level function will fail, but D3Callee() will not notice anything went wrong. In particular, it is possible that the address router is a deleted contract (or say a security bug/flaw was found OR selfdestruct was called so that users know to use an updated smart contract), but the above functions will not revert.

If the target address(address router) is indeed a non-existent contract, it would be better for above functions to revert. A contract existence check is very much required to prevent the issues.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1) Check for contract existence on low-level calls, so that failures are not missed.
2) check router address is not address(0).
