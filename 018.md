# Title: Bypassing Token Locking in D3Token's `transferFrom` Function

## Summary
The D3Token contract contains a vulnerability in the `transferFrom` function, allowing tokens to be transferred despite the sender having locked tokens. This vulnerability enables unauthorized transfers, potentially resulting in the loss of locked tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation of the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions in the provided code does not enforce the locked balance restriction. The checks for locked balances are only performed to ensure that the transferred amount does not exceed the available balance (excluding the locked balance) of the sender. However, there is no direct enforcement to prevent transfers of locked tokens.

## Impact
1. Unauthorized transfers: 
Users can transfer tokens even if they have locked token amounts, bypassing the intended restrictions.
3. Loss of locked tokens:
If tokens are transferred without considering the locked amounts, it can result in the loss of locked tokens that were meant to be restricted.
## Code Snippet
[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/periphery/D3Token.sol#L46-L51)
## PoC
```solidity
// Assuming `_locked` mapping is not updated or utilized properly

// Sender has locked tokens, but transfer succeeds
function maliciousTransfer(D3Token token, address recipient, uint256 amount) external {
    token.transferFrom(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Create a modifier called `requireUnlocked` that checks if the sender has any locked tokens:
```solidity
modifier requireUnlocked() {
    require(_locked[_msgSender()] == 0, "TRANSFER_NOT_ALLOWED");
    _;
}

```
2. Apply the `requireUnlocked` modifier to the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions:
```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public override requireUnlocked returns (bool) {
    // Existing transfer code
    // ...
}

function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public override requireUnlocked returns (bool) {
    // Existing transferFrom code
    // ...
}

```
With this approach, any attempt to transfer tokens by a sender who has locked tokens will be rejected, and the transaction will revert with the error message "`TRANSFER_NOT_ALLOWED`".
