# Title: Bypassing Token Locking in D3Token's transferFrom Function

## Summary
The D3Token contract contains a vulnerability in the `transferFrom` function, allowing tokens to be transferred despite the sender having locked tokens. This vulnerability enables unauthorized transfers, potentially resulting in the loss of locked tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the lack of utilization and updating of the `_locked` mapping in the contract code. The `_locked` mapping is not being used to check the locked token amounts during transfers, rendering the condition ineffective. Consequently, tokens can be transferred regardless of the locked amounts, bypassing the intended restrictions.
## Impact
1. Unauthorized transfers: 
Users can transfer tokens even if they have locked token amounts, bypassing the intended restrictions.
3. Loss of locked tokens:
If tokens are transferred without considering the locked amounts, it can result in the loss of locked tokens that were meant to be restricted.

## PoC
```solidity
// Assuming `_locked` mapping is not updated or utilized properly

// Sender has locked tokens, but transfer succeeds
function maliciousTransfer(D3Token token, address recipient, uint256 amount) external {
    token.transferFrom(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Implement the functionality to update and utilize the _locked mapping appropriately within the contract logic.
2. Ensure that the _locked mapping is updated when tokens are locked or unlocked for an address.
3. Modify the transferFrom function to consider the locked token amounts when checking the available balance for transfers.
