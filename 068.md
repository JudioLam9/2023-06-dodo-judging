# User can steal assets after DODO liquidation is finished

## Summary
When DODO finishes a liquidation by calling `finishLiquidation`, a user can claim debt returned to the pool for themselves.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a DODO liquidation is finished by calling `finishLiquidation`, the debt of the pool for each token (previously calculated in `startLiquidation`) is transferred from the pool back to the vault:

```solidity
IERC20(token).transferFrom(pool, address(this), debt);
```

The key issue is that the balance of the asset is not updated when this transfer is made. Now, any user can steal the assets for themselves by calling `userDeposit` since the following calculation is made:

```solidity
        AssetInfo storage info = assetInfo[token];
        uint256 realBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 amount = realBalance  - info.balance
```

## Impact
A user can effectively steal assets from other LPs who have already deposited to the vault (where the assets have been borrowed by a pool that has been liquidated).

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The balance of the asset should be updated in the vault when a DODO liquidation is finished:
