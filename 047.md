# Calls to liquidate don't write down totalBorrows which breaks exchange rate

## Summary
When a pool is liquidated, the `totalBorrows` storage slot for the token in question should be decremented by `debtToCover` in order to keep the exchange rate of the corresponding `pToken` correct.

## Vulnerability Detail
When users call `liquidate` to liquidate a pool, they specify the amount of debt they want to cover. In the end this is used to write down the borrow amount of the pool in question:

```solidity
record.amount = borrows - debtToCover;
```

However, the `totalBorrows` of the token isn't written down as well (like it should be). The `finishLiquidation` method correctly writes down the `totalBorrows` state. 

## Impact
When a user calls `liquidate` to liquidate a pool, the exchange rate of the token (from its pToken) remains high (because the `totalBorrows` for the token isn't decremented). The result is that users that have deposited this ERC20 token are receiving a higher rate of interest than they should. Because this interest is not being covered by anyone the end result is that the last withdrawer from the vault will not be able to redeem their pTokens because there isn't enough of the underlying ERC20 token available. The longer the period over which interest accrues, the greater the incentive for LPs to withdraw early.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `liquidate` method should include the following line to write down the total borrow amount of the debt token being liquidated:

```solidity
info.totalBorrows = info.totalBorrows - debtToCover;
```
