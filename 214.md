# On liquidation, an attacker can get collateral tokens without paying debt tokens to vault, or a user can end up paying debt tokens without getting collateral back in return

## Summary
On liquidation [D3VaultLiquidation.sol liquidate()](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultLiquidation.sol#L30), an attacker can get collateral tokens without paying debt tokens to vault. Also, a user can end up paying debt tokens without getting collateral back in return.

This is due to the fact that `transferFrom()` returns a success status which is unchecked here.

The IERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom() functions return a boolean value indicating success. If the transfer fails, some tokens return false instead of reverting the transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [D3VaultLiquidation.sol liquidate()](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultLiquidation.sol#L30-L61) function transfers debt tokens from user to vault and sends equivalent worth of collateral tokens from pool to the borrower.

Both token transfers are done using `IERC20.transferFrom` function.

The `IERC20.transfer()` and `IERC20.transferFrom()` functions return a boolean value indicating success. If the transfer fails, some tokens return false instead of reverting the transaction.

So if the debt and collateral tokens follow such a standard, the transfers can fail without reverting the transaction.

Case 1. An attacker can cause the debt token transfer to fail and still receive collateral tokens. 

Example:
If a borrower doesn't approve the vault (or use some other way to fail the debt token transfer) and calls `liquidate()`, the debt tokens won't get transferred to the vault, however, collateral tokens will be transfered to the borrower.

Case 2. If the collateral transfer to the user fails for any reason, the user will end up paying the debt tokens without receiving anything in return.


## Impact
Asset loss of either DODO protocol or user can occur:

1. Borrower can take collateral tokens back from the protocol without sending the required debt tokens
2. If the collateral transfer to the borrower fails, the borrower will end up paying the debt tokens without receiving anything in return

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function liquidate(.......) external nonReentrant {
        .
        .
        IERC20(debt).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), debtToCover); // debt transfer to vault

        record.amount = borrows - debtToCover;
        record.interestIndex = info.borrowIndex;

        IERC20(collateral).transferFrom(pool, msg.sender, collateralAmount); // collateral transfer to user
        ID3MM(pool).updateReserveByVault(collateral);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check.
