# Any caller can provide any msg.sender address and burn dTokens belonging to another account

## Summary
In the userWithdraw function, the msg.sender parameter is used to check the balance of dTokens held by the caller. However, it is not verified that the caller is the actual owner of the dTokens being burned.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability in the userWithdraw function is that it doesn't verify if the caller of the function is the actual owner of the dTokens being burned. The function relies on the msg.sender parameter to check the balance of dTokens and deduct the corresponding amount from the sender's balance.
However, in the Ethereum network, the msg.sender can be manipulated by an attacker by using a technique called "contract impersonation" or by using a proxy contract. This means that an attacker can call the userWithdraw function on behalf of another user and burn their dTokens without their consent
## Impact
Any user can withdraw the tokens on behalf of another user, potentially leading to unauthorized access to someone else's funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Pass the user address as an argument to the userWithdraw function and use it for verification instead of relying on msg.sender. By doing this, the function will ensure that only the actual owner of the dTokens can withdraw them
