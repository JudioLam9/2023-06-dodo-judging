# Wrong quota calculation with wrong exchangeRate

## Summary
The function `getUserQuota()` is intended to calculate the unused quota amount of `token`. But `token` was wrongly used in calculation of used quota for `_token` and leads the wrong result. 

When `D3VaultFunding#userDeposit()` is called, user may not deposit any tokens even the quota is not exceeded or may deposit some tokens even the quota is exceeded.
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/periphery/D3UserQuota.sol#L80
L80 is intended to calculate the amount of `_token` user could withdraw from D3Vault if burning all of `dToken` they holds. Then use it to calculate the used quota of ` _token` in virtual USD. But `token` was wrongly used, which will cause the wrong result of used quota for `_token`.

## Impact
When `D3VaultFunding#userDeposit()` is called, user may not deposit any tokens even the quota is not exceeded or may deposit some tokens even the quota is exceeded.

## Code Snippet

    tokenBalance = tokenBalance.mul(d3Vault.getExchangeRate(token));
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `_token` instead of `token` for function `getExchangeRate()`. Change the code in L80 as below:

    tokenBalance = tokenBalance.mul(d3Vault.getExchangeRate(_token));
