# Out of gas issue if `tokenList` grows too large.

## Summary
Out of gas issue when `tokenList` grows too large.
## Vulnerability Detail
Anytime a new token is added to the protocol the `tokenList` increases. although difficult this array may grow in time to become too large, Thereby making important functions that run a loop through this array fail due to `Out of gas` issues.
Some examples of these functions includes:

- D3VaultFunding.accrueInterests()
- D3VaultFunding._getTotalDebtValue()
- D3UserQuota.getUserQuota()

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that functions using the array can experience out-of-gas issues, potentially causing transaction failures and preventing users from successfully interacting with the contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a limit on the number of tokens that can be added. By enforcing a limit, the contract can prevent unbounded gas loops and ensure that the transactions do not run out of gas.
