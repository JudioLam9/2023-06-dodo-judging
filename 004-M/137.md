# Unauthorized Liquidation Start

## Summary

The `D3VaultLiquidation.sol` contract in the DODO V3 contract architecture allows unauthorized users to initiate the liquidation process for a DODO pool, potentially causing financial loss and disruption to the platform.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `startLiquidation` function in the `D3VaultLiquidation.sol` contract allows any external address to initiate the liquidation process for a DODO pool without proper authorization. The function can be called by any address that is classified as a "liquidator." However, the `onlyLiquidator` modifier applied to the function does not enforce any specific permission or role-based access control.

## Impact

Unauthorized users can start the liquidation process for any DODO pool, even if they do not have the authority to do so. This can lead to financial loss for the platform and its users if the liquidation process is initiated improperly or without proper consideration of the pool's financial state.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function startLiquidation(address pool) external onlyLiquidator nonReentrant {
    accrueInterests();

    require(!ID3MM(pool).isInLiquidation(), Errors.ALREADY_IN_LIQUIDATION);
    require(checkCanBeLiquidatedAfterAccrue(pool), Errors.CANNOT_BE_LIQUIDATED);
    ID3MM(pool).startLiquidation();

    uint256 totalAssetValue = getTotalAssetsValue(pool);
    uint256 totalDebtValue = _getTotalDebtValue(pool);
    require(totalAssetValue < totalDebtValue, Errors.NO_BAD_DEBT);

    uint256 ratio = totalAssetValue.div(totalDebtValue);

    for (uint256 i; i < tokenList.length; i++) {
        address token = tokenList[i];
        AssetInfo storage info = assetInfo[token];
        BorrowRecord storage record = info.borrowRecord[pool];
        uint256 debt = record.amount.div(record.interestIndex == 0 ? 1e18 : record.interestIndex).mul(info.borrowIndex).mul(ratio);
        liquidationTarget[pool][token] = debt;
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to introduce a proper role-based access control mechanism to restrict the `startLiquidation` function to authorized addresses only. This can be implemented by using a modifier that checks for the liquidator role or by utilizing a permission management system such as Access Control Lists (ACLs) to define and manage the roles and permissions within the contract.

## Proof of Concept

To reproduce this vulnerability, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the DODO V3 contracts, including the `D3VaultLiquidation.sol` contract.
2. Call the `startLiquidation` function of the `D3VaultLiquidation` contract from an unauthorized address that is not classified as a liquidator.
3. Observe that the liquidation process is initiated for the specified DODO pool, even though the caller does not have the proper authorization.

Note: This vulnerability requires the deployment and interaction with the actual DODO V3 contract architecture on a testnet or mainnet fork.
