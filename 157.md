# Internal vault's balance for debt token is not updated upon liquidation

## Summary
There are two types of liquidation in DODO. The first one is public liquidatation, during which the liquidator covers pool's debt by transfering debt token to the vault and receives collateral with discount in exchange. The other one is performed by DODO team in case there is a bad debt in the pool and by the end of it the debt amount of debtToken is transfered to the vault. Both of them doesn't update vault's debt token balance thus making a descrepancy between the actual and internal token amounts.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `liquidate()` function [takes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultLiquidation.sol#L35) as input the debtToCover parameter and then calls transferFrom on the debt token:
```solidity
        IERC20(debt).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), debtToCover);
```
Nowhere it updates the `assetInfo[debt].balance`.

Same with the `finishLiquidation()` function. It transfers the debt amount but doesn'y update the internal balance:
```solidity
            IERC20(token).transferFrom(pool, address(this), debt);
```

## Impact
Since `assetInfo[token].balance` is used in some major vault's calculations (e.g. the dTokenAmount a user would receive on [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultFunding.sol#L33-L39) or tokens on [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultFunding.sol#L56-L58)), not updating it might lead to wrong and unfair amounts minted or transfered.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the internal vault's balance upon liquidataion
For `liquidate()`:
```solidity
info.balance += debtToCover;
```
For `finishLiquidations()`:
```solidity
info.balance += debt;
```
