# An attacker can deploy a contract that inherits `IDODOSwapCallback`, and implement the `d3MMSwapCallBack()` function in a malicious way

## Summary
External calls are made to `IDODOSwapCallback(msg.sender)` during the `buyToken()` and `sellToken()` functions in the `D3Trading.sol` contract. These function calls are expected to be made by the `D3Proxy` but it isn't checked if the `msg.sender` actually is the proxy. An attacker can deploy a malicious contract that implements same interface as the proxy and change the callback function.

## Vulnerability Detail
Both the `buyToken()` and `sellToken()` functions in the `D3Trading.sol` contract makes an external call to the `msg.sender`, and I will explain how an attacker can exploit it. Let's examine the `sellToken()` function:  
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Pool/D3Trading.sol#L90-L127](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Pool/D3Trading.sol#L90C1-L127C1)

```solidity
// File: D3Trading.sol
    /// @notice user sell a certain amount of fromToken,  get toToken
91.    function sellToken(
92.        address to,
93.        address fromToken,
94.        address toToken,
95.        uint256 fromAmount,
96.        uint256 minReceiveAmount,
97.        bytes calldata data
98.    ) external poolOngoing nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
99.        require(ID3Maker(state._MAKER_).checkHeartbeat(), Errors.HEARTBEAT_CHECK_FAIL);
100.
101.        _updateCumulative(fromToken);
102.        _updateCumulative(toToken);
103.
104.        (uint256 payFromAmount, uint256 receiveToAmount, uint256 vusdAmount, uint256 swapFee, uint256 mtFee) =
105.            querySellTokens(fromToken, toToken, fromAmount);
106.        require(receiveToAmount >= minReceiveAmount, Errors.MINRES_NOT_ENOUGH);
107.
108.-->     _transferOut(to, toToken, receiveToAmount);
109.
110.        // external call & swap callback
111.-->     IDODOSwapCallback(msg.sender).d3MMSwapCallBack(fromToken, fromAmount, data);
112.        // transfer mtFee to maintainer
113.        _transferOut(state._MAINTAINER_, toToken, mtFee);
114.
115.        require(
116.-->         IERC20(fromToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - state.balances[fromToken] >= fromAmount,
117.            Errors.FROMAMOUNT_NOT_ENOUGH
118.        );
119.
120.        // record swap
121.-->     _recordSwap(fromToken, toToken, vusdAmount, receiveToAmount + swapFee);
122.        require(checkSafe(), Errors.BELOW_IM_RATIO);
123.
124.        emit Swap(to, fromToken, toToken, payFromAmount, receiveToAmount, swapFee, mtFee, 0);
125.        return receiveToAmount;
126.    }
```

A user called the function and the process of the function after it is called is as follows:

1. The function will send `toToken`s to the "to" address in line 108. I want to point out that the user has not sent the `fromToken`'s yet. But `toToken`s already sent to the user.
    
2. The function makes an external call to the `IDODOSwapCallback(msg.sender)` in line 111. This is the place where the user will send the `fromToken`s.  
    The issue here is that `msg.sender` is not checked at all. It is assumed to be the D3proxy but it can be anyone.
    
3. The balance comparison is made in line 116 to check if the fromToken's actually sent by the user.
    
4. The state is updated in line 121.
    

Additionally to these, I also want to point out that the `fromToken` balance of the user is not checked before sending `toToken`s to them. The only check is if `fromToken` balance is increased at the end or not. So, users can call this function without having any `fromToken` but if they can find enough `fromToken` between these calls, that's still okay. I will explain this later below in the attack scenario.

The reason for this vulnerability is that there are two issues combined at the same time. The `toToken`s are sent before getting any payment at all, and the `msg.sender` is not checked.

### Attack Scenario

In this protocol, there might be a lot of pools and these pools might have multiple tokens. Some pools might be healthy and some of them can be liquidated by anyone.  
For example:  
One pool has token A, token B, token C and token D, and this pool is healthy. Let's call it `pool H`.  
Another pool has token A, token B, token Y and token Z, and this pool can be liquidated. Let's call this one `pool L`. Token A has a negative balance in this pool. 
The attacker watches the pool states and finds a pool that can be liquidated

The attacker follows these steps:

1. Deploy a contract that inherits `IDODOSwapCallback`. (I will provide an example contract below)
    
2. Start the attack by calling `sellToken()` function in the healthy `pool H`. Sell token B for token A.  
    *This will send token A to the attacker but he didn't pay the token B yet.*
    
3. Inside the `d3MMSwapCallBack()`, call [`liquidate()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultLiquidation.sol#L30) function of the `D3VaultLiquidation.sol`. The arguments while calling this will be:  
    pool: `pool L`  
    debt: `token A` (Pool L had a negative balance for token A)  
    collateral: `token B`
    
4. This call will send token A from the attacker to the vault, and send token B to the attacker with a discounted price.  
    *The token A's that attacker sent are the token A's that they get 2 steps above.* *They still didn't pay anything.*
    
5. Send the necessary token B to `pool H` as the last step of the callback function.
    
6. Take the difference token B as a profit.
    

Here is a simple example attacker contract:

```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity 0.8.19;

    import {IERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol" 

    interface IDODOSwapCallback {
        function d3MMSwapCallBack(address token, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external;
    }

    contract Attacker is IDODOSwapCallback {
    // constructor & variables etc... Not writing completely for brevity, just an example.


        // Start the attack by calling the healthy pool and sell token B for token A.
        // Right after that, pool H will make callback to the function below.
        function attack() external onlyOwner {
            // Sell 1000 token B. This will send token A to this contract.
            poolH.sellToken(address(this), tokenB, tokenA, 1000, 0, );
        }
        
        // This will be called by the pool H after sending token A's.
        function d3MMSwapCallBack(address token, uint256 value, bytes calldata _data) external override {
            // check how much token A has been sent to this contract.
            allTokenAWeGet = IERC20(tokenA).balanceOf(address(this);
            
            // Pool to liquidate is poolL.
            // debt token is token A, collateral token is token B.
            // Call the liqudate function with a profit margin. For example 1040.
            // If it reverts with this profit margin, no problem. We didn't pay anything.
            // Call the function with all the token A we get from previous step. 
            vault.liquidate(poolL, tokenB, 1040, tokenA, allTokenAWeGet);
            
            // Send 1000 token B to the healty pool to finish execution.
            IERC20(tokenB).transfer(poolH, 1000);
        }
    }
```

The contract above is just an example of how an attack can be made. You might have a few questions like "These functions are `nonReentrant`, how will it work?" The answer is the [nonReentrant](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol) modifier updates the contract's state and prevents entering the same contract again. But the pool contract and the vault contract have completely different states. The first step of the attack is calling the healthy pool, and the second step is calling the vault to liquidate the unhealthy pool.

You can say "Attacker can directly liquidate the pool and still get the collateral with a discounted price. Why would they need to do that?"  
The answer to this is that if they want to liquidate directly, they have to have the funds. They have to buy the tokens from the open market, send them to liquidate and get the collateral. But during the attack they don't have to pay anything. It uses one pool's tokens to liquidate the other pool. The **cost is 0** and the reason is that `toToken`s are sent to the user before they pay it to the pool.  
They get the money before they pay for it, and their transaction will execute if they make a profit with that free money, otherwise it will simply revert. No loss for attackers. They can even make it a step further. They can constantly watch all the pools --> Choose one negative balance and one positive balance token in the pool anytime when they find a pool that can be liquidated --> Repeat the attack above. 

I uploaded this vulnerability as a medium severity because it requires a few different pool conditions to happen at the same time. It can be executed in a sweet spot of time. The cost is 0 but the probability is low. But if you consider it as high, I wouldn't say no :)

## Impact
An attacker can create a malicious contract to make profit from the protocol with the protocol's own money. Details of the possible impact is explained above in the vulnerability details section.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There might be a few ways to mitigate this issue.

* The first one is making sure that the external call is made to a safe contract. Save the D3Proxy address in the pool state and add an "***onlyProxy"*** modifier.
    
* Don't send tokens to the seller/buyer before getting the tokens from them.
    
* Check if the seller/buyer actually has enough balance to pay.
