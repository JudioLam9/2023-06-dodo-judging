# There is an issue with the synchronization of the `tokenList` in the `liquidationTarget` after executing the `D3Vault#addNewToken` function.

## Summary
There is an issue with the synchronization of the `tokenList` in the `liquidationTarget` after executing the `D3Vault#addNewToken` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem arises when adding a new token to the `tokenList` in the `D3Vault` contract. During the liquidation process, which involves two steps, the `startLiquidation` function adds liquidation data to the `liquidationTarget` map. Then, in the second step, the `finishLiquidation` function loops through the `tokenList` to process the data in the `liquidationTarget` map.

However, if the `tokenList` is updated between the first and second steps, the `liquidationTarget` map fails to be fully liquidated.

## Impact
The impact of this bug is that the liquidation process may not function correctly if the `tokenList` is modified between the steps of the liquidation process. This can lead to incomplete or inaccurate liquidation results.

```solidity
// Relevant code snippet demonstrating the issue

function addNewToken(address token) public {
    // Add new token to tokenList
    tokenList.push(token);
}

function startLiquidation(address token) public {
    // Add liquidate data to liquidationTarget
    liquidationTarget[token] = true;
}

function finishLiquidation() public {
    // Loop through tokenList and process liquidation data in liquidationTarget
    for (uint256 i; i < tokenList.length; i++) {
        // Process liquidation data
        uint256 debt = liquidationTarget[pool][token]
       
        }
    }
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, it is recommended to ensure the synchronization of the `tokenList` and `liquidationTarget` during the liquidation process. One possible solution is to update the `liquidationTarget` map whenever the `tokenList` is modified. This can be achieved by adding appropriate logic in the `addNewToken` function to handle the synchronization.

Additionally, thorough testing should be conducted to verify that the liquidation process functions correctly even when the `tokenList` is modified between the liquidation steps. This will help identify and address any potential edge cases or race conditions.
