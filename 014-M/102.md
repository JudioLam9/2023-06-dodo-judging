# Wrong calculation of compoundediterest in D3VaultFunding

## Summary

The compunded interest is miscalculated for any timeframe bigger than 2 seconds, resulting in loss of interests.

## Vulnerability Detail

In [D3VaultFunding.sol:getCompoundInterestRate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultFunding.sol#L178-L189) the compounded interest rate should be calculated and returned.
Given is the interest rate per second `r` and the time in seconds `t`.
The general formula for this is `(1+r) ** t`. 
The function uses an if statement to check for special cases like `t<1`, meaning `t=0` where the result is simply `1` (`1e18` with decimals), and `t<2`, meaning `t=1` where the result is `1+r*t`.
For all other cases the function uses the following calculation

```solidity
    return 1e18 + r * t + r.powFloor(2) * t * (t - 1) / 2;
``` 

While this will give us the correct resut for `t=2`, it will return a wrong amount for all values of `t>2`.
The devs even state in the comment in [D3VaultFUnding.sol:L180](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultFunding.sol#L180) that the correct rearrangement of the formula is `(1+r)^t = 1 + rt + t*(t-1)*r^2/2! + t*(t-1)*(t-2)*r^3/3! + ... + t*(t-1)...*(t-n+1)*r^n/n!`

A short example demonstrates this. If we take `r=5` and `t=3` we get:

```plaintext
1.:

(1+r) ** t 
= (1+5) ** 3 
= 6 ** 3 
= 216

2.:

1 + r*t + r ** 2 * t * (t-1) /2 
= 1 + 5*3 + 5 ** 2 * 3 * (3-1) / 2
= 1 + 15 + 25 * 3 * 2 / 2
= 16 + 75 
= 91
```

This function is used inside `_accrueInterestForRead` and `getLatestBorrowIndex`.

## Impact

Too less interest accrued for all cases where the function is called for a value of `t>2`
