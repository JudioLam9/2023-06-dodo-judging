# Title: Precision Loss Vulnerability in Token Pricing Calculation

## Summary
The contract code contains potential precision loss due to integer division, which may result in truncation of decimal places during calculations.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the provided contract code, there are divisions performed to calculate `innerSlotIndex` and `slotIndex` using the variables `state.priceListInfo.numberOfStable` and `state.priceListInfo.numberOfNS`. If the divisor (`MakerTypes.PRICE_QUANTITY_IN_ONE_SLOT`) is not a multiple of the dividend, there is a possibility of precision loss due to integer division. The division operation discards the fractional part, resulting in a truncated value.
## Impact
The precision loss can lead to incorrect calculations and inaccurate results. In financial and numerical operations, maintaining precise decimal places is crucial. Precision loss can introduce errors in pricing, indexing, or any other calculations relying on accurate values. This can potentially impact the overall functionality and reliability of the contract.
## Code Snippet
[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Pool/D3Maker.sol#L158-L213)
## Proof of Concept (PoC):
Assume `MakerTypes.PRICE_QUANTITY_IN_ONE_SLOT` is 10 and `state.priceListInfo.numberOfStable` is 15. The code performs the division `state.priceListInfo.numberOfStable / MakerTypes.PRICE_QUANTITY_IN_ONE_SLOT` to calculate `slotIndex`.
Expected Calculation:
`state.priceListInfo.numberOfStable / MakerTypes.PRICE_QUANTITY_IN_ONE_SLOT = 15 / 10 = 1.5`
Actual Calculation:
`state.priceListInfo.numberOfStable / MakerTypes.PRICE_QUANTITY_IN_ONE_SLOT = 15 / 10 = 1` (integer division truncates the decimal part)
In this case, the precision loss occurs as the expected fractional part (`0.5`) is lost due to integer division.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Use decimal arithmetic libraries: Implement a decimal arithmetic library to perform precise calculations involving decimal values. Libraries like SafeMathDecimal can help avoid precision loss during calculations.
2. Avoid integer division: If maintaining decimal places is crucial, consider using fixed-point arithmetic or other approaches that preserve precision during division. This might involve scaling the values appropriately to retain decimal accuracy.
3. Perform sanity checks: Verify that the divisor (`MakerTypes.PRICE_QUANTITY_IN_ONE_SLOT`) is a multiple of the dividend (`state.priceListInfo.numberOfStable or state.priceListInfo.numberOfNS`) before performing the division. This check ensures that the division operation won't result in precision loss.
