# Missing Check for Arbitrum Sequencer

## Summary

There is no check if the Arbitrum Sequencer is online, when fetching the Chainlink Oracle

## Vulnerability Detail

When Chainlin is used in L2 networks, like Arbitrum, it is required to check if the Sequencer is online. If the sequencer is down, prices may look fresh, altough they arent.

Therefore the getPrice function from the Oracle may return stale prices.

## Impact

A malicious user could leverage stale prices when the Sequencer is down.
