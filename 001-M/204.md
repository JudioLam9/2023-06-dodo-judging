# No check if Arbitrum/Optimism L2 sequencer is `down` in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
No check if Arbitrum/Optimism L2 sequencer is `down` in Chainlink feeds
## Vulnerability Detail
Using Chainlink in L2 chains such as Arbitrum and Optimism requires checking if the sequencer is down to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh although they are not.
The bug could be leveraged by malicious actors to take advantage of the sequencer downtime.

Before requesting the price, the contract should check the status of the sequencer - https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds
## Impact
Stale oracle prices would falsify the calculation of account liquidity which e.g. can lead to the following issues:

- Wrong liquidation (when pool liquidity is assumed lower than it actually is based on correct asset market prices)

- Allows borrowing too much assets (when account liquidity is assumed higher than it actually is based on correct asset market prices)

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Follow the suggestions of Chainlink and determine whether the sequencer is available or not. Don't allow logic that depends on it succeed in the IronBank protocol when sequencer is offline to not get exposure to potentially stale prices and the associated risks.
