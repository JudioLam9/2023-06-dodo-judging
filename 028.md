# Critical D3Callee Function Vulnerability in D3MMLiquidationRouter

## Summary
The D3Callee function within the D3MMLiquidationRouter contract can be called by anyone, allowing unauthorized users to trigger unwanted liquidation transactions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [*D3Callee*](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/a8d30e611acc9762029f8756d6a5b81825faf348/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/periphery/D3MMLiquidationRouter.sol#L23) function in the D3MMLiquidationRouter contract does not have any access control mechanism in place. This means that anyone can call this function and execute liquidation swaps without proper authorization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to trigger unwanted liquidation transactions, potentially causing financial losses or disruption of the liquidation process.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that anyone can call this function and supply their own Router address. If an attacker provides a malicious Router contract that always returns true, the execution will proceed as expected, leading to the transfer of the toToken balance to the caller's address.

This vulnerability allows an unauthorized user to exploit the function and receive the toToken balance by manipulating the router address. It can result in a loss of funds for the contract owner or unintended liquidation actions without proper authorization.

**Steps**
- Create a new Hack Router contract
```solidity
contract TestRouter {
    function test() external pure returns (bool) {
        return true;
    }
}
```

- Create hackRouteData
```solidity
bytes memory hackRouteData = abi.encodeWithSignature("test()");
```

- Call liquidationRouter.D3Callee with hacker account:
```solidity
vm.prank(hacker);
liquidationRouter.D3Callee(order, address(testRouter), hackRouteData);
```

This part of the D3Callee function should pass and return true, so hacker should able to transfer token

```solidity
 IERC20(order.fromToken).approve(_DODO_APPROVE_, type(uint256).max);
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = router.call(routeData);
        if (!success) {
            assembly {
                revert(add(data, 32), mload(data))
            }
        }
```

D3Callee 
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is significant. Unauthorized users can initiate liquidation swaps, leading to unexpected liquidation events and potential financial losses for the affected parties. This vulnerability can also disrupt the normal liquidation process and introduce chaos into the system.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
   function D3Callee(LiquidationOrder calldata order, address router, bytes calldata routeData) external {
        IERC20(order.fromToken).approve(_DODO_APPROVE_, type(uint256).max);
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = router.call(routeData);
        if (!success) {
            assembly {
                revert(add(data, 32), mload(data))
            }
        }
        IERC20(order.toToken).transfer(msg.sender, IERC20(order.toToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
    ```

## Tool used

Foundry Manual Review



## Recommendation
It is recommended to implement an access control mechanism to restrict the invocation of the D3Callee function to authorized users or contracts. This can be achieved by using OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract or implementing a custom access control mechanism. By implementing access control, only trusted entities will be able to execute the liquidation swaps, mitigating the risk of unauthorized liquidations and potential financial losses.

It should only be called by "liquidator"
```solidity
   function D3Callee(LiquidationOrder calldata order, address router, bytes calldata routeData) external onlyLiquidator{
        IERC20(order.fromToken).approve(_DODO_APPROVE_, type(uint256).max);
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = router.call(routeData);
        if (!success) {
            assembly {
                revert(add(data, 32), mload(data))
            }
        }
        IERC20(order.toToken).transfer(msg.sender, IERC20(order.toToken).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
    ```
