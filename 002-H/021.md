# Calling poolRepayAll breaks accounting for the token in question

## Summary
The `poolRepayAll` method exists to allow a pool to repay the whole borrow balance for a specific token. When a borrow is repaid, the balance of the token in question should increase to allow other pools to borrow or users to withdraw. This occurs correctly in the `poolRepay` method, but not in the `poolRepayAll` method.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `AssetInfo.balance` struct member is used to keep track of the balance available of a token for user withdrawals and pool borrowing. Borrows and withdrawals should decrease the balance, whereas deposits and borrow repayments should increase the balance. The issue is that the `poolRepayAll` method decreases the balance of the token when it should be increasing the balance.

## Impact
When a pool repays their whole borrow balance they actually further decrease the balance available for borrowing and for user withdrawals. The impact is that other pools can't borrow that token asset and users can't withdraw that token asset either. The accounting failure will have a massive impact throughout the protocol since it also affects exchange rate calculations among others.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Increase the token balance in the `poolRepayAll` method rather than decreasing the token balance. Below is a diff:
