# `poolRepayAll` decreases the balance of the Vault instead of increasing it.

## Summary
In `D3VaultFunding` contract, `poolRepayAll` should increase the balance of a vault to the amount received from a borrower, but it's decreasing instead.

## Vulnerability Detail
Vaults keep track of their token balance in a separate `AssetInfo.balance` field and borrowing or repaying should update that field accordingly.

`poolRepayAll` allows repaying all debt at once. It's alternative is `poolRepay` that allows to specify the amount to be repaid.
Calling these functions should increase the `AssetInfo.balance` since these operations transfer tokens from a borrower to a vault. 

`poolRepay` does that, but in `poolRepayAll` the `AssetInfo.balance` is decreasing instead of increasing.

## Impact
This bug breaks the invariant of the Vault contract.

If Bob will call the `userDeposit` right after the Alice's `poolRepayAll` call, the unaccounted increase in the token balance of the Vault contract will accounted to Bob.

0. Imagine that Vault's `AssetInfo.balance` = 10000 DAI
1. Alice owes 1000 DAI to the vault
2. Alice calls `poolRepayAll` and this calls decreases `AssetInfo.balance` to 1000 DAI. so `AssetInfo.balance` = 9000 DAI, whereas contract's real DAI balance = 11000 DAI
3. Bob calls `userDeposit` with 1 DAI
4. The amount that Bob transferred is calculated by substracting `AssetInfo.balance` from the real balance of the vault
6. `uint256 amount = realBalance  - info.balance;` => `amount = 11001 - 9000 = 2001 DAI` which is way higher than what Bob actually transferred

```solidity
function _poolRepayAll(address pool, address token) internal {
  accrueInterest(token);

  AssetInfo storage info = assetInfo[token];
  BorrowRecord storage record = info.borrowRecord[pool];
  uint256 amount = record.amount.div(record.interestIndex == 0 ? 1e18 : record.interestIndex).mul(info.borrowIndex);

  uint256 interests = amount;

  record.amount = 0;
  record.interestIndex = info.borrowIndex;
  info.totalBorrows = info.totalBorrows - amount;
  info.balance = info.balance - amount; // @audit-info should be + amount
  IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(pool, address(this), amount);

  emit PoolRepay(pool, token, amount, interests);
}
```

    uint256 interests = amount;

    record.amount = 0;
    record.interestIndex = info.borrowIndex;
    info.totalBorrows = info.totalBorrows - amount;
-   info.balance = info.balance - amount;
+   info.balance = info.balance + amount;
    IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(pool, address(this), amount);
