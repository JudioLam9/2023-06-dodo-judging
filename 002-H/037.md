# The `_poolRepayAll` function in D3VaultFunding.sol is failing to update the `info.balance` accurately, resulting in a substantial loss of funds for the protocol.

## Summary
The `_poolRepayAll` function in D3VaultFunding.sol fails to update the `info.balance` correctly, resulting in users receiving an excessive amount of `dtokens` when depositing funds. This issue leads to a substantial loss of funds for the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_poolRepayAll` function in the D3VaultFunding.sol contract inaccurately subtracts the repaid borrowed amount from the `info.balance` instead of adding it, resulting in an erroneous calculation. This issue leads to a scenario where a user who deposits the same token immediately after the pool has fully repaid the borrowed amount receives an excessive amount of `dtokens` as a result.

To illustrate this problem, let's consider the following scenario:

1. Initially, the D3Vault contains 200 Dai, resulting in a `Vault balance` of 200 Dai and an `info.balance` of 200 Dai.
2. The pool borrows 100 Dai using the `poolBorrow` function, causing the `Vault balance` to decrease to 100 Dai and the `info.balance` to become 100 Dai.
3. The pool subsequently repays all the borrowed Dai using the `poolRepayAll` function. However, due to the incorrect calculation, the `Vault balance` increases back to 200 Dai (assuming zero interest accrued), while the `info.balance` erroneously becomes 0 Dai instead of the expected 200 Dai.
4. In the meantime, a user deposits 10 Dai using the `userDeposit` function. This results in a `realBalance` of 210 Dai (the sum of the Vault balance and the user's deposited Dai). However, since the `info.balance` is incorrectly calculated as 0 Dai, the `amount` parameter for minting `dTokens` is determined as the difference between the `realBalance` and `info.balance`, which equals 210 Dai - 0 Dai = 210 Dai.
5. As a consequence, the user is minted with `dTokens` worth 210 Dai instead of the expected 10 Dai. This discrepancy causes a loss of 200 Dai worth of `dTokens` for the protocol.

It is crucial to address this issue in order to ensure accurate calculations and prevent further losses for the protocol.

## Impact
The impact of the vulnerability is substantial, and it is directly correlated with both the pool's repaid amount and the user's deposited amount. In situations where the pool's borrowed amount surpasses the available balance in the `D3Vault`, the pool becomes incapable of fully repaying the borrowed amount through the `poolRepayAll` function.

## Recommendation
Instead of subtracting the `amount` from `info.balance` add it.
```info.balance = info.balance + amount;```
