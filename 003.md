# userDeposit can be frontrun to steal funds

## Summary
`userDeposit` finalilzes a deposit. A user is supposed to send tokens first to the vault and then D tokens get minted to his address when passing checks such as `checkQuota`. However, anyone can call userDeposit and front run a deposit made to claim the tokens. Also if multiple deposits for the same token happen in one block, the user who calls `userDeposit` first will get all credited for all the deposits. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The function checks the remaining quota for `user` and gets the difference between the balance of the deposited token and the balance last known via `info.balance` divided by the `exchangeRate`. It mints that amount to the `user` address. 
Let's say Bob deposits 1 token A and then wants to call `userDeposit` to claim his tokens.
Alice frontruns and will get the tokens minted.
## Impact
A user transferring tokens to the vault will lose its deposits and won't be able to claim it back.

```solidity
 /// @notice user should transfer token to vault before call this function
    function userDeposit(address user, address token) external nonReentrant allowedToken(token) {
        accrueInterest(token);

        AssetInfo storage info = assetInfo[token];
        uint256 realBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 amount = realBalance  - info.balance;
        require(ID3UserQuota(_USER_QUOTA_).checkQuota(user, token, amount), Errors.EXCEED_QUOTA);
        uint256 exchangeRate = _getExchangeRate(token);
        uint256 totalDToken = IDToken(info.dToken).totalSupply();
        require(totalDToken.mul(exchangeRate) + amount <= info.maxDepositAmount, Errors.EXCEED_MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT);
        uint256 dTokenAmount = amount.div(exchangeRate);

        IDToken(info.dToken).mint(user, dTokenAmount);
        info.balance = realBalance;

        emit UserDeposit(user, token, amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The way it works now is flawed since it can be easily frontrun. It might be good to keep track of deposits and use that as a reference. It's unclear to me if the functions are only to be called from the proxy or not, if so check for that.
