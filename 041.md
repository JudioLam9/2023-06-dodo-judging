# `isInLiquidation` variable issues that is not being checked before returning true

## Summary
-  `checkCanBeLiquidated()` function in the `D3Funding` contract does not check the `isInLiquidation` variable before returning true.
 means that the function could return true even if the contract is in liquidation so An attacker could exploit this bug by observing a stale larger value of `checkCanBeLiquidated()` and withdrawing tokens from the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
- the `isInLiquidation` variable not being checked before returning true from the `checkCanBeLiquidated()` function, this caused a problem in the `checkCanBeLiquidated()`  function we have `isInLiquidation = true`  variable, this variable is not checked before the function returns true. so  the function could return true even if the contract is in liquidation. as an example :
let's say that the contract is in liquidation and the value of ` isInLiquidation`  is set to true. Then, an attacker could observe this value and withdraw tokens from the contract. The attacker could then use these tokens to repay their debt to the contract, which would make the contract no longer in liquidation, the attacker would still have the tokens that they withdrew, which they could then sell or use for other purposes.
```solidity
function startLiquidation() external onlyVault {
        isInLiquidation = true;
    }
```
## Impact
- The attacker can steal tokens with this.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- `checkCanBeLiquidated()` function should be modified to check the `isInLiquidation` variable before returning true.
