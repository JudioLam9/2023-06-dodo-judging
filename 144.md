# missing deadline check allows pending transactions to be maliciously executed

## Summary

When calling `sellToken` the user doesn't have the option to specify a deadline, exposing them to malicious MEV.

## Vulnerability Detail

Typically AMMs provide users the option to specify a limit for when their transaction can be executed. In D3Proxy when calling `sellTokens` the user is able to provide a deadline which is validated, however the protocol allows the user to call D3Trading `sellTokens` directly. 

In the second case there is no `deadline` parameter leaving the user susceptible to loss of funds due to MEV. This can occur if the supplied transaction fee is too low for miners to be interested in including the transaction in a block. The transaction can stay pending in the mempool for extended periods. During this period, even though the number of tokens received by the user may not change due to the slippage check. 

## Impact

The user's trade can remain pending for an extensive time, leading to a bad trade for the user
