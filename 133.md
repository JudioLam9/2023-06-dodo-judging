# All D3Pool can only call borrow() or makerDeposit() once for those tokens require zero allowance before approving new non-zero allowance.

## Summary
The protocol can not support those tokens which don't allow to change allowance from non-zero to non-zero in `ERC20.approve()` function because the allowance is wrongly used.

Above codes are intended to check if the vault(`state._D3_VAULT_`) has enough allowance of `token` approved by the pool(`D3Funding`) to ensure it could force liquidate the pool when necessary. It should check the allowance that `state._D3_VAULT_` could spend on behalf of `D3Funding`, but somehow it checked the allowance that `D3Funding` could spend on behalf of `state._D3_VAULT_`, which is always zero because there is no way to change it. Because of that, `IERC20(token).approve()` will always be executed every time when either of `borrow()`, `updateReserveByVault()` and `makerDeposit()` is called.

It's not a big problem for most of ERC20 tokens except only some extra gas is consumed. But there are still some tokens like [USDT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code), the allowance can be changed to a non-zero value only when it is zero. Any attempt of changing allowance from non-zero to non-zero will be reverted.
If a pool plans to provide USDT, All `borrow()`, `updateReserveByVault()` and `makerDeposit()` calling will fail except the first time.

## Impact

The protocol can not support those tokens which don't allow to change allowance from non-zero to non-zero in `ERC20.approve()` function.

Change the code in above lines as blow:

    uint256 allowance = IERC20(token).allowance(address(this), state._D3_VAULT_);
