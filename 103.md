# calculateQuota function is vulnerable to arithmetic underflow.

## Summary 
In file D3UserQuota.sol, calculateQuota function is vulnerable to arithmetic underflow. 
And the visibility of this function is not required to be public.

## Vulnerability Detail
If getUserQuota function is called before setQuotaTokennAmount is called, quotaTokenAmount.length is still 0 on calculateQuota function.
It can lead to arithmetic underflow issues.

## Impact
On the not global token hold, if getUserQuota is reverted, the following behavior could be unexpected.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the logic that returns zero quota if quotaTokenAmount.length.
And calculateQuota function should have internal visibility.
