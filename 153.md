# Execution should revert when `receiveToAmount > state.balances[toToken]`

## Summary
An issue arises within the `D3Trading.sol` smart contract (function : `querySellTokens`), specifically in the calculation of the `receiveToAmount` parameter. When `receiveToAmount` exceeds the value of `state.balances[toToken]`, instead of triggering a revert condition, the `receiveToAmount` is mistakenly set equal to `state.balances[toToken]`. This erroneous behavior leads to substantial losses of funds for the user.
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following scenario:

1. Alice intends to trade `100` tokens of `token1` for `token2` and sets the minimum expected receiving amount (`minReceiveAmount`) to `190`. Let's assume that the balance of `token2` in the contract (`state.balance[token2]`) is currently `200`.

2. During the execution of the `querySellTokens` function, the calculation for the `receiveToAmount` parameter is performed. Based on the exchange rate, Alice should receive `210` tokens of `token2` in return for supplying `100` tokens of `token1`.

3. However, due to an error in the code, the `receiveToAmount` is mistakenly assigned a value of `200` when it exceeds the balance of `token2` held in the contract (`state.balance[token2]`).

4. Consequently, Alice receives only `200` tokens of `token2` instead of the expected `210` tokens. This discrepancy results in a loss of `10` tokens of `token2` for Alice.
