# Title: Inaccurate Balance Check in `buyToken` Function

## Summary
The `D3Trading` contract contains a vulnerability that results in an inaccurate balance check within the `buyToken` function. This issue can lead to incorrect checks for the available balance of the `fromToken` in the contract, potentially allowing transfers that exceed the actual token balance.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `buyToken` function performs a balance check using the expression `IERC20(fromToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - state.balances[fromToken] >= payFromAmount`. However, this approach fails to account for tokens that have already been transferred out of the contract but have not been properly updated in the `state.balances` mapping.

## Impact
1. Loss of funds: Due to the inaccurate balance check, the contract may allow token transfers even when the available balance is insufficient. This can result in the loss of funds as users mistakenly believe they have sufficient tokens in the contract.
2. Incorrect token purchases: Users relying on the balance check to determine the availability of tokens may end up purchasing tokens that the contract does not have enough balance to fulfill. This can lead to failed transactions and a loss of trust in the contract's functionality.

## PoC (Proof of Concept):
1. Prepare the environment:

- Deploy the vulnerable `D3rading`contract on a testnet or local blockchain network.
- Set up accounts for the contract owner, user A, and user B.
- User A holds a significant amount of the `fromToken` in their account.
2. Exploiting the balance check vulnerability:

- User A initiates a transaction to buy a large amount of `toToken` from the contract using the `buyToken` function.
- User A sets a `maxPayAmount` that is equal to or slightly higher than the actual available balance of `fromToken` in the contract.
- Due to the balance check vulnerability, the contract incorrectly considers the stored balance of `fromToken` as the available balance and approves the transaction.
- The contract transfers the requested toToken to User A, depleting the stored balance of `toToken` in the contract.
3. Subsequent transaction failure:

- User B attempts to sell their `fromToken` to the contract using the `sellToken` function.
- User B sets a `fromAmount` based on their available `fromToken` balance.
- However, the contract fails to execute the transaction since the actual available balance of fromToken is lower than the specified `fromAmount`.
- User B's transaction fails, causing frustration and potential financial loss.
This PoC demonstrates how the inaccurate balance check can lead to successful purchases without considering the actual available balance of `fromToken` in the contract. It also highlights the subsequent failure of transactions when users rely on the balance check to determine the available token balance.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Implement an accurate balance tracking mechanism:
- Modify the contract to keep track of the total tokens transferred out of the contract and deduct them from the stored balance of `fromToken`. This ensures that the stored balance accurately reflects the actual available balance of `fromToken` in the contract.
2. Enhance the balance check in the buyToken function:
- Instead of comparing the stored balance of `fromToken` with the `payFromAmount`, compare the actual available balance (considering tokens transferred out) with the `payFromAmount`.
