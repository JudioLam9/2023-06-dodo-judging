# D3Vault.sol#removeD3Pool() removes wrong pool due to equality instead of assignment.

## Summary

Due to an equality operator being used instead of an assignment operator the last pool will always be removed instead of the specified pool.

## Vulnerability Detail

When removing a pool from a creators poollist the last item is intended to first be copied into the position of the item being removed so that when the last item is removed a copy still exists in the array. However as == is used the array remains unchanged and the last item will be removed while the intended pool will still remain.

## Impact

Admins can accidently remove the incorrect pool from the vault.
