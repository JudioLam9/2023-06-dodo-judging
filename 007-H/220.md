# Typographical Error in Element Swapping in `removeD3Pool` Function

## Summary

The function `removeD3Pool` contains a typographical error. The line `poolList[i] == poolList[poolList.length - 1];` should be modified to `poolList[i] = poolList[poolList.length - 1];` to correct the assignment of values.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `removeD3Pool` function, there is a typo where a comparison operator `==` is mistakenly used instead of the assignment operator `=`. This error prevents the intended swapping of values between `poolList[i]` and `poolList[poolList.length - 1]`.

## Impact
The impact of this typographical error is that the swapping of elements in the `poolList` array does not occur as intended. This can potentially lead to incorrect data manipulation or unexpected behavior in subsequent code execution.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function removeD3Pool(address pool) external onlyOwner {
        require(allPoolAddrMap[pool] == true, Errors.POOL_NOT_ADDED);
        ID3MM(pool).startLiquidation();

        allPoolAddrMap[pool] = false;
        _PENDING_REMOVE_POOL_ = pool;
        address creator = ID3MM(pool)._CREATOR_();
        address[] memory poolList = creatorPoolMap[creator];
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < poolList.length; i++) {
            if (poolList[i] == pool) {
                poolList[i] == poolList[poolList.length - 1]; //@audit instead of == they must have used =
                creatorPoolMap[creator] = poolList; 
                creatorPoolMap[creator].pop();
                emit RemovePool(pool);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix the issue, replace the erroneous comparison operator `==` with the correct assignment operator `=` in the line `poolList[i] == poolList[poolList.length - 1];`. The corrected line should be `poolList[i] = poolList[poolList.length - 1];`. This will ensure that the elements in the poolList array are correctly swapped, avoiding any potential data manipulation or unexpected behavior.
