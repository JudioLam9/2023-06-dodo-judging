# Critical Vulnerability: Unrestricted ETH Withdrawal in D3Proxy Contract

## Summary
The [refundETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/a8d30e611acc9762029f8756d6a5b81825faf348/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/periphery/D3Proxy.sol#L189) function in the D3Proxy contract allows anyone to withdraw ETH from the contract if there is a positive balance available. This can lead to unintended access to contract funds by unauthorized users.

## Vulnerability Detail
The refundETH function does not include any access control or permission checks. As a result, anyone can call this function and receive the ETH balance of the contract. This lack of restriction allows potential attackers to drain the contract's ETH balance.

## Impact
The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to withdraw ETH from the contract, potentially resulting in financial loss or depletion of the contract's funds. It violates the intended access control mechanisms and poses a security risk.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
/// @dev when fromToken = ETH and call buyTokens, call this function to refund user's eth
function refundETH() external payable {
    if (address(this).balance > 0) {
        _safeTransferETH(msg.sender, address(this).balance);
    }
}
```
## Tool used
Foundry test

** Test Code**
```solidity
function testRefundETH() public {
        vm.deal(address(d3Proxy), 2 ether);

        //anyone can ask for refund
        address alice = address(777);
        assertEq(alice.balance, 0);
        vm.prank(alice);
        d3Proxy.refundETH();
        emit log_named_uint("alice balance", alice.balance);
        assertEq(alice.balance, 2000000000000000000);
    }
```

## Recommendation
It is important to implement proper access control mechanisms and permission checks to ensure that only authorized users can withdraw ETH from the contract. Consider adding modifiers or require statements to restrict the access to functions that handle contract balances. Additionally, conduct a comprehensive review of the contract's functionality and logic to identify and address any other potential vulnerabilities.
