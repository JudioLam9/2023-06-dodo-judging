# Failed router swap with low level call could be overlooked in D3VaultLiquidation.sol

## Summary
Failed router swap with low level call could be overlooked

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact
In D3VaultLiquidation.sol,

```Solidity
File: contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/D3VaultLiquidation.sol

87    function liquidateByDODO(
88        address pool,
89        LiquidationOrder calldata order,
90        bytes calldata routeData,
91        address router
92    ) external onlyLiquidator nonReentrant {
93        uint256 toTokenReserve = IERC20(order.toToken).balanceOf(address(this));
94        uint256 fromTokenValue = DecimalMath.mul(ID3Oracle(_ORACLE_).getPrice(order.fromToken), order.fromAmount);
95
96        // swap using Route
97        {
98            IERC20(order.fromToken).transferFrom(pool, router, order.fromAmount);
99            (bool success, bytes memory data) = router.call(routeData);
100            if (!success) {
101                assembly {
102                    revert(add(data, 32), mload(data))
103                }
104            }
105        }

         // some code
```

According to the Solidity docs, “The low-level functions call, delegatecall and staticcall return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed”.

As a result, it is possible that at L-99, this call low level function will not work but liquidateByDODO will not notice anything went wrong. It could be possible that a user is interacting with an exchange or token that has been deleted, but liquidateByDODO  will not notice
that something has gone wrong and as a result and the router swap can get failed. For this reason, it would be better to also check for the contract’s existence prior to executing liquidateByDODO().

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1) Make sure to check that router contract address actually exists before calling it by low level call function in liquidateByDODO(). Verify router address existence before calling it. 
2) Prevent _address router_ from being set as address(0) and add address(0) check for _address router_
