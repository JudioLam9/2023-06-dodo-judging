# Title: Incomplete Repayment Risk in `liquidateByDODO` Function

## Summary
The `liquidateByDODO` function in the provided contract code does not adequately verify whether the liquidator transfers the correct amount of debt tokens during the liquidation process. This vulnerability creates a risk of incomplete repayment, potentially leading to an imbalance in the liquidation and loss of funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `liquidateByDODO` function allows the liquidator to swap tokens by transferring a specific amount of one token (`fromToken`) and receiving another token (`toToken`) in return. However, the code lacks proper checks to ensure that the liquidator transfers the exact amount of debt tokens required for a successful liquidation, potentially enabling them to transfer an insufficient amount.
## Impact
1. Imbalance in Liquidation: Insufficient repayment of the negative worth debt due to incomplete transfers could disrupt the liquidation process and result in an imbalance between debt and collateral.
2. Loss of Funds: Incomplete repayment compromises the integrity of the system, leading to potential financial losses for the pool and its participants.
## Proof of Concept (PoC):
1. The liquidator initiates the `liquidateByDODO` function and specifies the `fromToken`, `toToken`, and `fromAmount`.
2. Instead of transferring the precise amount of debt tokens (`fromToken`) required, the liquidator transfers an insufficient amount.
3. The function proceeds with the token swap, allowing the liquidator to receive collateral tokens (`toToken`) without fully repaying the negative worth debt.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this security concern, it is advised to implement a robust verification mechanism within the `liquidateByDODO` function to ensure that the liquidator transfers the exact amount of debt tokens required. The following code snippet presents a suggested approach:
```solidity
// Ensure the liquidator transfers the precise amount of debt tokens
require(
    IERC20(order.fromToken).balanceOf(msg.sender) >= order.fromAmount,
    "Insufficient debt token balance"
);

```
By including this verification, the function will revert if the liquidator's address holds an insufficient amount of debt tokens, preventing incomplete repayments and safeguarding the liquidation process.
