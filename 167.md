# `init` function leat  anyone to gain control of the `contract` caused by not protected by any `access control` mechanism

## Summary
- `init` function is not protected by any access control mechanism making a problem in contract, and leading to exploit by someone and make contract to lose funds by changing the `originToken` by a malicious user. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The `init` function is not protected by any access control mechanism so this a big problem can cause contract a lot as losing control so This problem in the `init` function  means that any account can call this function and change the `originToken`, `_symbol`, and `_name` of the contract. 
```solidity
  function init(address token, address pool) external {
        initOwner(pool);
        originToken = token;
        _symbol = string.concat("d3", IERC20Metadata(token).symbol());
        _name = string.concat(_symbol, "_", addressToShortString(pool));
    }

```
the more complex and dangerous is that if someone is able to  Change the `originToken` to a malicious token this let him to steal funds from users of the contract, ans also to change the `_symbol` or `_name` to something that is misleading or confusing leading to users making mistakes. 
## Impact
- this problem allow attacker to gain control of the contract and steal funds from all users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- add a function modifier like `onlyOwner` to this function to restrict access.
```solidity
function init(address token, address pool) external onlyOwner {
    initOwner(pool);
    originToken = token;
    _symbol = string.concat("d3", IERC20Metadata(token).symbol());
    _name = string.concat(_symbol, "_", addressToShortString(pool));
}
```
