# Traders can force pool liquidation to steal funds

## Summary
There exists an interesting code path that allows a trader to swap tokens under the IM Ratio and perform a liquidation, prior to the final IM ratio check at the end of the swap. The trader will be able to steal funds through liquidation fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
Imagine a pool has two tokens. Token A and token B. 
- Pool has $800k worth of token A
- Pool **borrows** $200k worth of token B
- A malicious trader calls `D3Trading.sellToken()` to swap
