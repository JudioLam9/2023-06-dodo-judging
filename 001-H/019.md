# Anyone can call refundETH in D3Proxy

## Summary
Anyone can call this function to claim eth in the proxy contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The idea is that the function is called in a multicall when calling `buyToken` with `toToken == eth`. I'm convinced that if that is the case the contract needs to make sure it can only be used in that way. Any user calling `buyToken` with `toToken == eth` will lose its eth as anyone can call this function. I don't think this is a user error since this is very specific and the proxy contract can be used in different ways, with or without multicall. I believe there can be taken better measures to protect the user.
## Impact
Users lose funds if they are not familiar with the inner mechanics of the contract.

```solidity
  function refundETH() external payable {
        if (address(this).balance > 0) {
            _safeTransferETH(msg.sender, address(this).balance);
        }
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the function and call the `_safeTransferETH` directly where needed. The same applies for `withdrawWETH`
