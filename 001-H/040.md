# D3Proxy.refundETH() can be used to steal the ETH balance of D3Proxy.sol

## Summary
D3Proxy.refundETH() is external and therefore callable by anyone

## Vulnerability Detail
D3Proxy.refundETH() does a transfer to msg.sender with the ETH balance of D3Proxy.sol
```solidity
 function refundETH() external payable {
        if (address(this).balance > 0) {
            _safeTransferETH(msg.sender, address(this).balance);//@audit take note of address(this).balance
        }
    }
```


## Impact
The ETH balance of D3Proxy.sol can be emptied by anyone via D3Proxy.refundETH() even though the funds doesn't belong to them.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
i think D3Proxy.refundETH() should be internal and used immediately in functions where it is possible for user to over send ETH.
