# Anyone can steal a user's excess ETH

## Summary
In the Proxy.sol contract, it has a function that allows users to get any excess amount of ETH in the contract if there is any, but the function can be called by anyone who doesn't have any excess ETH left in the contract or didn't interact with the contract, and if called the function sends to the caller the contracts entire balance.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the refundETH function.
```solidity
    function refundETH() external payable {
        if (address(this).balance > 0) {
            _safeTransferETH(msg.sender, address(this).balance);
        }
    }
```
You can see it sends the contract's entire balance to anyone that calls it, not minding if the excess ETH belongs to the caller.
## Impact
Anyone can call this function before the actual owner of the excess ETH left in the contract, and take any excess ETH in the contract even though it doesn't belong to them.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Store any excess ETH left in the contract by linking to the User's balance via a mapping.
Instance.
```solidity
mapping(address => uint) public excessETHUserBalance;
```
The refundETH function will then go like this -->
```solidity
    function refundETH() external payable {
    require(excessETHUserBalance[msg.sender] > 0, "You don't have any Exess ETH in the contract")
       uint amount = excessETHUserBalance[msg.sender];
        if (address(this).balance > 0) {
            _safeTransferETH(msg.sender, amount);
        }
    }
```

Any time a user interact's with the contract the excess ETH left by the User should be stored in the excessETHUserBalance, to keep track of the user's balance.
