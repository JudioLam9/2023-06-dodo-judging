# Tokens get stuck if userDeposit reverts

## Summary
A user can deposit funds by transferring a token to the vault and then calling `userDeposit`. If the function reverts, there's no way to get his deposited funds back.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are two checks in `userDeposit`. One is to see if the user has enough quota left and another is to see if the vault hasn't exceeded its max deposit amount. If one of those would fail, which is certainly reasonable to assume, the user won't be credited D tokens and he won't be able to withdraw. 
## Impact
User loses funds when `userDeposit` reverts. They are stuck in the contract.

```solidity

    /// @notice user should transfer token to vault before call this function
    function userDeposit(address user, address token) external nonReentrant allowedToken(token) {
        accrueInterest(token);

        AssetInfo storage info = assetInfo[token];
        uint256 realBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 amount = realBalance  - info.balance;
        require(ID3UserQuota(_USER_QUOTA_).checkQuota(user, token, amount), Errors.EXCEED_QUOTA);
        uint256 exchangeRate = _getExchangeRate(token);
        uint256 totalDToken = IDToken(info.dToken).totalSupply();
        require(totalDToken.mul(exchangeRate) + amount <= info.maxDepositAmount, Errors.EXCEED_MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT);
        uint256 dTokenAmount = amount.div(exchangeRate);

        IDToken(info.dToken).mint(user, dTokenAmount);
        info.balance = realBalance;

        emit UserDeposit(user, token, amount);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the function is only to be called from the proxy, have a check for that.
