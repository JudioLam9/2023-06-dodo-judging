# Liquidation undercuts the liquidator

## Summary
The ```liquidate``` function handles liquidation and retrieval of collateral. However, liquidations do not favor the liquidator due to this 
```solidity
        uint256 collateralTokenPrice = ID3Oracle(_ORACLE_).getPrice(collateral);
        uint256 debtTokenPrice = ID3Oracle(_ORACLE_).getPrice(debt);
        uint256 collateralAmountMax = debtToCover.mul(debtTokenPrice).div(collateralTokenPrice.mul(DISCOUNT));

        require(collateralAmount <= collateralAmountMax, Errors.COLLATERAL_AMOUNT_EXCEED);
```
## Vulnerability Detail
Due to market conditions or mathematical errors,  the ```collateralAmount ``` initially inputted by the liquidator can be considerably smaller than the ```collateralAmountMax ``` therefore, Instead of getting the max calculated reward which is safe to pay for their liquidations, they get transferred whatever amount they inputted and still cover the ```debtToCover``` used to get the max amount
This can be seen here is the initial collateralAmount being transferred
```solidity
  IERC20(debt).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), debtToCover);

        record.amount = borrows - debtToCover;
        record.interestIndex = info.borrowIndex;
        IERC20(collateral).transferFrom(pool, msg.sender, collateralAmount);
        ID3MM(pool).updateReserveByVault(collateral);
```
## Impact
Users can get less collateral for debt payment. Eventually the pool negative worth can be fully repaid and the collateral unpaid to the liquidator would remain in the DD3 pool contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I believe that the collateral should be calculated within the function. On the otherhand, a minimumcollateralAmount can be introduced to check that atleast a minimum value of collateral is gotten. Therefore we check for a minimum value and send the contract calculated amount
