# return value of ERC20.transferFrom() is not checked, can cause loss of funds/stuck funds in D3VaultLiquidation

## Summary
The return value of transferFrom() is not checked 

## Vulnerability Detail
The return value of transferFrom() is not checked, transfers can fail unexpectedly maybe due to insufficient allowance or any other reason  and this will result in the function assuming the transfer was successful.

## Impact
transferFrom is unsafe and also since the return value isn't checked in the startLiquidation() function and liquidateByDODO() function, these functions may assume the transfer was successful leading to loss of funds / stuck funds
