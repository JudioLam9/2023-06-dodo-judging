# possible precision loss when calculating `borrows` in D3VaultLiquidation.liquidate() because of division before multiplication

## Summary
 D3VaultLiquidation.liquidate() divides before multiplying when calculating `borrows`

## Vulnerability Detail
please take a look at the snippet below
```solidity
 uint256 borrows = record.amount.div(record.interestIndex == 0 ? 1e18 : record.interestIndex).mul(info.borrowIndex);
//@audit it divides before multiplying 
```
--- record.amount is divided by 1e18 if record.interestIndex == 0 or by record.interestIndex if it's != 0, then it's multiplied by info.borrowIndex

lets say:
record.amount = 5000,
record.interestIndex = 7,
record.borrowIndex = 5,

Now normal maths will have 5000 / 7 which will give 714.2857142857 then multiplying it by 5 = 3571.4285714285

But in solidity when we do 5000/7 we'll have 714 and not 714.285714285 because solidity truncates values when dividing, then multiplying by 5 we'll have 3570 instead of 3571.4285714285. 

In the above instance there's a loss of about 1.428571428500163

## Impact
1. precision loss when calculating `borrows` in  D3VaultLiquidation.liquidate()

2. it might affect the require statement below it making it to revert in a situation where user puts his exact record.amount as debtToCover when calling D3VaultLiquidation.liquidate()
```solidity
 require(debtToCover <= borrows, Errors.DEBT_TO_COVER_EXCEED);
```
because of the precision loss the borrows calculated will loss precision and be lesser than debtToCover.


3. incorrect values will be updated here
```solidity
 record.amount = borrows - debtToCover;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
look for a more efficient way to calculate borrows but don't divide before multiplying so as to avoid precision loss
