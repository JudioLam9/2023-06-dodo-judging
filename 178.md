# Wrong assignment of `cumulativeBid` for RangeOrder state in getRangeOrderState function

## Summary

Wrong assignment of `cumulativeBid` for RangeOrder state

## Vulnerability Detail

In `D3Trading`, the `getRangeOrderState` function is returning RangeOrder (get swap status for internal swap) which is assinging wrong toTokenMMInfo.cumulativeBid which suppose to be `cumulativeBid` not `cumulativeAsk`

The error lies in the assignment of `roState.toTokenMMInfo.cumulativeBid`. Instead of assigning `tokenCumMap[toToken].cumulativeAsk`, it should be assigning `tokenCumMap[toToken].cumulativeBid`.

```js
File: D3Trading.sol
86:         roState.toTokenMMInfo.cumulativeBid =
87:             allFlag >> (toTokenIndex) & 1 == 0 ? 0 : tokenCumMap[toToken].cumulativeAsk;
```

This wrong assignment value definitely will mess up accounting balance, resulting unknown state will occure, which is not expected by the protocol

For one case, this `getRangeOrderState` is being used in `querySellTokens` & `queryBuyTokens` which may later called from `sellToken` and `buyToken`. The issue is when calling `_contructTokenState` which can be reverted from `PMMRangeOrder` when buy or sell token

```js
File: PMMRangeOrder.sol
100:         // B
101:         tokenState.B = askOrNot ? tokenState.B0 - tokenMMInfo.cumulativeAsk : tokenState.B0 - tokenMMInfo.cumulativeBid;
```

When the `tokenMMInfo.cumulativeBid` (which was wrongly assign from `cumulativeAsk`) is bigger than `tokenState.B0`, this will revert

## Impact

This wrong assignment value definitely will mess up accounting balance, resulting unknown state will occure, which is not expected by the protocol. For example reverting state showing a case above.

## Recommendation

Fix the error to

```diff
File: D3Trading.sol
86:         roState.toTokenMMInfo.cumulativeBid =
--:             allFlag >> (toTokenIndex) & 1 == 0 ? 0 : tokenCumMap[toToken].cumulativeAsk;
++:             allFlag >> (toTokenIndex) & 1 == 0 ? 0 : tokenCumMap[toToken].cumulativeBid;
```
