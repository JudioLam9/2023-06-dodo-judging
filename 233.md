# Contract's transaction will revert due to  divide-by-zero error

## Summary
In the getUtilizationRatio function, there is no  check to handle the division by zero scenario when borrows is zero.
## Vulnerability Detail
In this function, the borrows variable is obtained from the getTotalBorrows function, which represents the total amount borrowed. If borrows is zero, it means that there are no outstanding borrows for the given token. In this case, the function directly returns 0 to represent zero utilization ratio.
However, the division operation borrows.div(cash + borrows - reserves) is not guarded against the scenario when borrows is zero. If borrows is zero, it will lead to a division by zero error, causing the contract to revert.
## Impact
It will revert the entire transaction, discarding any state changes made before the exception

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to avoid division by zero. One way to handle this is by checking if the sum of cash and borrows is zero, and if so, return 0 to represent no utilization.
