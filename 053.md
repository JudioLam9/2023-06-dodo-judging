# Chainlink aggregators return the minAnswer price if it's below minAnswer

## Summary

Chainlink aggregators have a built in circuit breaker if the price is below `minAnswer`, which can lead to inaccurate prices being accepted by the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

Chainlink's latestRoundData pulls the associated aggregator and requests round data from it. ChainlinkAggregators have minAnswer and maxAnswer circuit breakers built into them. This means that if the price of the asset drops below the minAnswer, the protocol will continue to value the token at minAnswer instead of it's actual value. This will allow users to exploit certain parts of the protocol.
See [Chainlink's docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#check-the-latest-answer-against-reasonable-limits) for more info.

## Impact

Users can continue to interact with the protocol with an incorrect price, leading to potential exploits. This is exactly what happened to [Venus on BSC when LUNA imploded](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/).
