# Pools that borrow same token as collateral can't be liquidated

## Summary
Because of the require statements in the `D3VaultLiquidation.liquidate()` function, a pool that borrows the same token as its collateral can never be liquidated.

```solidity
require(isPositiveNetWorthAsset(pool, collateral), Errors.INVALID_COLLATERAL_TOKEN);
require(!isPositiveNetWorthAsset(pool, debt), Errors.INVALID_DEBT_TOKEN);
```

If the pool has both collateral in TokenA and debt in TokenA, it's impossible for both require statements to pass.

## Vulnerability Detail
Looking into the test file `D3Funding.t.sol` gives some clarity into the possibility of this vulnerability:

```solidity
function testCanBeLiquidated() public {
    vm.startPrank(poolCreator);
    d3Proxy.makerDeposit(address(d3MM), address(token1), 41 * 1e8);
    d3MM.borrow(address(token1), 100 * 1e8);


    // pass
    vm.warp(315300000000);
    uint256 ratio = d3Vault.getCollateralRatio(address(d3MM));
    assertEq(ratio, 0);
    bool can = d3MM.checkCanBeLiquidated();
    assertEq(can, true);
}
```

- The poolCreator deposits **41 token1**
- Then borrows **100 token1**
- Time passes
- The `checkCanBeLiquidated()` call returns **true**

Looking at the `checkCanBeLiquidated()` function, it simply checks the collateral ratio is below the maintenance margin:

```solidity
function checkCanBeLiquidated(address pool) public view returns (bool) {
    return getCollateralRatio(pool) < 1e18 + MM;
}
```

But when someone calls  `D3VaultLiquidation.liquidate()`, it will always revert because the single TokenA can not satisfy both conditions `isPositiveNetWorthAsset` and `!isPositiveNetWorthAsset`.

```solidity
function liquidate(
    address pool,
    address collateral,
    uint256 collateralAmount,
    address debt,
    uint256 debtToCover
) external nonReentrant {
    accrueInterests();

    require(!ID3MM(pool).isInLiquidation(), Errors.ALREADY_IN_LIQUIDATION);
    require(!checkBadDebtAfterAccrue(pool), Errors.HAS_BAD_DEBT);
    require(checkCanBeLiquidatedAfterAccrue(pool), Errors.CANNOT_BE_LIQUIDATED);
    require(isPositiveNetWorthAsset(pool, collateral), Errors.INVALID_COLLATERAL_TOKEN);
    require(!isPositiveNetWorthAsset(pool, debt), Errors.INVALID_DEBT_TOKEN);
    require(getPositiveNetWorthAsset(pool, collateral) >= collateralAmount, Errors.COLLATERAL_AMOUNT_EXCEED);

   ...
```

**NOTE:** It's also worth noting that the test file `D3VaultLiquidation.t.sol` contains tests for multiple different liquidation scenarios but does not have a single test case for the scenario where the pool only has a single token as both collateral and debt.

## Impact
- PoolCreators can borrow unlimited amounts without the ability to be liquidated

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
This is tricky to mitigate due to the various functions that allow borrowing and swapping between different tokens. Perhaps the best action is to create a new function that can handle liquidating pools that only contain a single token as opposed to altering the current `liquidate()` function to support said scenario.
