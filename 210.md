# Hardcoded minimum amount will cause issues for some ERC20 tokens

## Summary
The set Minimum amount will only work (best) for ERC20 Tokens with 4 decimals, other than that it will raise some issues.
## Vulnerability Detail
Since the protocol interacts with `any` ERC20 token, The issue arises when users attempt to deposit tokens with decimal places that differ from the protocol's expected decimal precision, such as WBTC (8 decimals) or WETH (18 decimals)

This leads to challenges in determining the appropriate minimum deposit amount. In the case of WETH, the minimum amount becomes `insignificant`, which disrupts the intended functioning of the protocol.
```solidity
function querySellTokens(
        address fromToken,
        address toToken,
        uint256 fromAmount
    ) public view returns (uint256 payFromAmount, uint256 receiveToAmount, uint256 vusdAmount, uint256 swapFee, uint256 mtFee) {
        require(fromAmount > 1000, Errors.AMOUNT_TOO_SMALL);
        Types.RangeOrderState memory D3State = getRangeOrderState(fromToken, toToken);
//more code....
}
```
This issue also occurs in `D3Trading.queryBuyTokens`
```solidity
function queryBuyTokens(
        address fromToken,
        address toToken,
        uint256 toAmount
    ) public view returns (uint256 payFromAmount, uint256 receiveToAmount, uint256 vusdAmount, uint256 swapFee, uint256 mtFee) {
        require(toAmount > 1000, Errors.AMOUNT_TOO_SMALL);
        Types.RangeOrderState memory D3State = getRangeOrderState(fromToken, toToken);
//more code....
}
```
## Impact
Users can deposit dust amounts, thus breaking the protocol's intentions.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of using a hardcoded minimum amount that applies to all ERC20 tokens, it would be more realistic to dynamically calculate the minimum amount based on the token's decimal precision.
