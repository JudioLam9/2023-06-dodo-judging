# Frontraning init function in the D3Token contract [M1]

## Summary

D3Token contract have an init function that everyone can call.
This could lead to a race condition when the contract is deployed. At that moment a hacker could call the init function and make the deployed contracts useless. Then it would have to be redeployed, costing a lot of gas.

## Vulnerability Detail

After deploating a contract, the init function can be called by anyone and this will assign the caller as the owner of the contract

## Impact

At least losses on the price of gas, for the redeployment of the contract.
However, if not traced that the init function is triggered by the attacker, can lead to more tangible losses.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/D3Vault/periphery/D3Token.sol#L24-L29

```solidity
    function init(address token, address pool) external { 
        initOwner(pool);
        originToken = token;
        _symbol = string.concat("d3", IERC20Metadata(token).symbol());
        _name = string.concat(_symbol, "_", addressToShortString(pool));
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check to the init function, for example that only the deployer can call the function.
