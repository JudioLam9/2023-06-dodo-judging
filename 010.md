# userDeposit reentrancy

## Summary
The userDeposit function in the D3Proxy contract may be vulnerable to a reentrancy attack, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the possibility of reentrancy in the _deposit function called by userDeposit. If an attacker can manipulate the claimTokens implementation in the IDODOApproveProxy contract, they could trigger a reentrancy attack, allowing them to execute additional malicious code before the token transfer is completed.

## Impact
If exploited, the reentrancy vulnerability could enable an attacker to manipulate the contract's state or invoke functions that may lead to unexpected behavior, financial loss, or even contract malfunction.
