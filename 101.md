# Anyone can call `withdrawWETH()` function in the `D3Proxy.sol` and exploit the contract

## Summary
The `withdrawWETH()` function doesn't have any access control. Anyone can call `withdrawWETH()` function in the `D3Proxy.sol` and drain all the WETH balance of the contract

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability is caused by no access control check in the `withdrawWETH()` function in `D3Proxy.sol` contract. You can see the code below:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-dodo/blob/main/new-dodo-v3/contracts/DODOV3MM/periphery/D3Proxy.sol#L195-L203

```solidity
    /// @dev when toToken == eth, call this function to get eth
    /// @param to The account address to receive ETH
    /// @param minAmount The minimum amount to withdraw
    function withdrawWETH(address to, uint256 minAmount) external payable {
        uint256 withdrawAmount = IWETH(_WETH_).balanceOf(address(this));
        require(withdrawAmount >= minAmount, "D3PROXY_WETH_NOT_ENOUGH");

        _withdrawWETH(to, withdrawAmount);
    }
``` 

There are two functions which one of them is **external** payable `withdrawWETH`, and the other one is **internal** `_withdrawWETH` with the underscore.  

The intention was to call the internal function during `buyTokens` & `sellTokens` when the `toToken == ETH`. That part works normally but the **external** **payable** `withdrawWETH` function doesn't have any access control. Anyone can call this function and it will transfer all the WETH balance of the `D3Proxy.sol`.
 

## Impact
Anyone can drain the whole WETH balance of the `D3Proxy.sol` contract.

```solidity
    /// @dev when toToken == eth, call this function to get eth
    /// @param to The account address to receive ETH
    /// @param minAmount The minimum amount to withdraw
    function withdrawWETH(address to, uint256 minAmount) external payable {
        uint256 withdrawAmount = IWETH(_WETH_).balanceOf(address(this));
        require(withdrawAmount >= minAmount, "D3PROXY_WETH_NOT_ENOUGH");

        _withdrawWETH(to, withdrawAmount);
    }
``` 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add access control modifiers to the function.
