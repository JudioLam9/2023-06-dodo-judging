# Title: Loss of Precision in Token Value Calculation

## Summary
The contract code suffers from a loss of precision issue in the calculation of token values in the `liquidateByDODO` function. The omission of decimal places in the calculations can lead to inaccurate token value assessments.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `fromTokenValue` and `toTokenValue` calculations in the `liquidateByDODO` function do not consider decimal places, potentially resulting in imprecise token value assessments. This can lead to incorrect comparisons and decisions based on token values, affecting the accuracy of liquidation operations.
## Impact
1. Inaccurate token value assessments may result in liquidators receiving an inadequate amount of collateral tokens in exchange for the repayment of negative worth debt tokens.
2. The loss of precision can impact the fairness and effectiveness of the liquidation process, potentially leading to financial losses for both the liquidators and the protocol.
## Code Snippet

## Proof of Concept:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating token values and their decimal places, potentially receiving more collateral tokens than they should or manipulating the liquidation process.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure proper decimal handling: Implement precise decimal handling mechanisms when calculating token values to avoid loss of precision. Utilize libraries such as `DecimalMath` or `SafeMath` to perform arithmetic operations accurately.
