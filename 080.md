# Title: Absence of Range Verification for Utilization Ratio Input

## Summary
The `D3RateManager` contract lacks range checking on the utilization ratio input in the `getBorrowRate` function, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities and incorrect interest rate calculations.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `getBorrowRate` function in `D3RateManager` does not perform explicit range checking on the `utilizationRatio` parameter. It assumes that the input value will be within a valid range without validating or enforcing any constraints.
Here's an example of how you could add a range check to the getBorrowRate function:
```solidity
function getBorrowRate(address token, uint256 utilizationRatio) public view returns (uint256 rate) {
    require(utilizationRatio <= 1e18, "Utilization ratio must be <= 1e18"); // Adjust the range as needed

    RateStrategy memory s = rateStrategyMap[token];
    if (utilizationRatio <= s.optimalUsage) {
        rate = s.baseRate + utilizationRatio.mul(s.slope1);
    } else {
        rate = s.baseRate + s.optimalUsage.mul(s.slope1) + (utilizationRatio - s.optimalUsage).mul(s.slope2);
    }
}

```
In this example, a `require` statement is used to validate that the utilization ratio is less than or equal to `1e18`. You can adjust the range check condition based on the expected range for the utilization ratio in your specific use case.
## Impact
1. Incorrect Interest Rate Calculations: If an invalid or unexpected utilization ratio is provided, the function may produce incorrect interest rate calculations, leading to inaccurate borrowing rates.
2. Financial Losses: Incorrect interest rate calculations can result in borrowers being charged the wrong interest rates, potentially causing financial losses for both borrowers and lenders.

## Proof of Concept (PoC):
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing an out-of-range utilization ratio to the getBorrowRate function, causing the calculation to produce incorrect interest rate results. For example, providing a utilization ratio greater than the expected maximum value or a negative utilization ratio could trigger unexpected behavior and incorrect interest rate calculations.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Implement Range Checking: Add explicit range checking on the utilization ratio input within the `getBorrowRate` function. Verify that the utilization ratio falls within the expected range before performing calculations.
